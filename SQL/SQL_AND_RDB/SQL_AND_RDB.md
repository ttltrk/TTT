#### WELCOME

Welcome to SQL and Relational Database 101!
Database software usage is pervasive.
Its presence is everywhere, from retrieving money through an automatic teller machine,
to badge access at a secure office location.
Yet it is basically taken for granted every day by billions of users worldwide.
In computer science, databases are among the most researched domains.
And, there are multiple types of databases to suit various industry requirements.
In this course, you'll learn the relational database model and the basics of the SQL language
through a series of components: There are five modules, covering an introduction to
relational databases (including definitions), information and data models, and relational
model constraints.
You are also introduced to five basic SQL statements, including some advanced techniques
in retrieving data from one or more relational database tables.
At the end of each module, there are three review questions to test your knowledge and
understanding of the concepts.
You'll also be able to apply what you've learned through four hands-on labs so you can try
out these concepts yourself.
Then, you'll be ready to take the 15-question final exam!
From start to finish, this course should take you less than four hours.
And, as Spock said in the movie Wrath of Kahn, "For everything there is a first time".

#### INTRO

Hello, and welcome to SQL and Relational Database 101.
First, we will talk a little bit about what you'll learn in this course.
This course teaches you the basics of the SQL language and the relational database model.
This course is the first in a series of courses. There will be some lab exercises, and at the
end of each section, there are a few review questions, and at the end there is a final
exam.
By the end of this course, you will be able to discuss SQL basics and explain various
aspects of the relational database model.
In this video, we will learn about SQL and relational databases.
By the end of this video, you will be able to describe SQL, data, database, a relational
database, and list five basic SQL commands.
So let's get started on SQL and Relational Database 101.
But wait, what is SQL and what is a relational database?
What is SQL?
SQL is a language used for relational databases to query or get data out of a database.
"S Q L" is also referred to as "sequel", and is short for it's original name "Structured
English Query Language".
So SQL is a language used for a database to query data.
So what is data? And what is a database?
Data is a collection of facts in the form of words, numbers, or even pictures.
Data is one of the most critical assets of any business.
It is used and collected practically everywhere.
Your bank stores data about you, your name, address, phone number, account numbers, etc.
Your credit card company, and your Paypal accounts also store data about you.
Data is important. So it needs to be secure, and it needs to be stored and accessed quickly.
The answer is a database.
So, what is a database?
Databases are everywhere, and used every day, but they are largely taken for granted.
A database is a repository of data. It is a program that stores data.
A database also provides the functionality for adding, modifying and querying that data.
There are different kinds of databases of different requirements.
The data can be stored in various forms.
When data is stored in tabular form, the data is organized in tables, like in a spreadsheet
which is columns and rows. That's a relational database.
The columns contain properties about the item, such as Last Name, First Name, email, address,
City.
A table is a collection of related things, like a list of employees, or a list of book
authors.
In a relational database, you can form relationships between tables.
So, a database is a repository of data.
A set of software tools for the data in the database is called a database management system,
or DBMS for short.
The terms database, database server, database system, data server, and database management
systems are often used interchangeably.
For relational databases, it's called a relational database management system, or RDBMS.
RDBMS is a set of software tools that controls the data, such as access, organization, and
storage.
An RDBMS serves as the backbone of applications in many industries including banking, transportation,
health, and so on.
Examples of relational database management systems are: MySQL, Oracle Database, and DB2
Express-C.
For the majority of people using a database, there are 5 simple commands to:
* Create a table * Insert data to populate the table
* Select data from the table * Update data in the table, and
* Delete data from the table
So those are the building blocks for SQL and Relational Database 101.
Now you can describe what is SQL, what is data, what is a database, and, what is a relational
database.
You know that RDBMS stands for relational database management system.
And, you can list 5 basic SQL commands to create a table, insert data to populate the
table, select data from the table, update data in the table, and delete data from the
table.
