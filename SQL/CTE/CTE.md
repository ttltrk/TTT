### CTE

---

```
CTE - Common Table Expression

As you can see, it is done using a WITH statement. For this reason, CTEs are also called WITH queries. After the WITH, you define a CTE in parenthesis. Defining CTE simply means writing a SELECT query which will give you a result you want to use within another query.
```

```sql
WITH expression_name AS (CTE definition)
```
