### 12_SQL_DEVELOPER

Well, that's it. We've finished our Oracle Database Developer Explorer learning path. So what's next for you? Well, this training has set you on the path here to becoming a database developer, certainly just a SQL developer, an XML developer, PL/SQL developer, or an Application Express developer.

And, of course, these developers here would be responsible for creating, right, and maintaining database components. And any person proceeding down the Oracle Database developer path would certainly gain them the necessary skills to either convert existing or develop new applications here to run within an Oracle Database environment.

If we look specifically at the Oracle Database Developer, there are three primary areas here, or topic areas to cover. One, of course, is SQL and SQL Developer. The next area would be PL/SQL, and that PL stands for Program Language of SQL, and a PL/SQL developer. And then finally, of course, there is the Application Express, or APEX Developer.

The specific paths that we have listed for them, of course, is your starting point here. And for SQL Developer, would be, then, the Oracle Database SQL Workshop 1. You would proceed on, then, to SQL Workshop 2, and then there is a certification examination that you can take. There is a preparatory seminar here that you can sit through. And of course, then, in turn, take, then, the certification test.

The next year you can concentrate on, of course, would be analytic SQL here for data warehousing, which then, in turn, uses more here along the lines of set operators and so forth, working with and manipulating here larger sets of data. And then there is the SQL and PL/SQL new features.

This one, of course, would be specific here to one of the later releases of the Oracle Database. Next area that you can go to, of course, is the PL/SQL Workshop. And you'll note this one here is for the 19C version of our database. Then there's managing your PL/SQL code, and there is a certification examination seminar here, a preparation seminar, for PL/SQL as well.

And completing those here and, of course, the certifications, would then, in turn, allow you, here, to receive your certification. Continuing on here, the PL/SQL side of the fence here, on this one here, there's the 12C advanced PL/SQL or E11G advanced PL/SQL. And, of course, these are for those here that are a little bit more experienced in their training, or experienced here with SQL and PL/SQL, and they want to dive into greater and deeper concepts.

You'll note there is also then, in turn, depending on which advanced PL/SQL you take, there is an advanced PL/SQL certification exam as well. And for those in Japan, right here, you can see that there is an advanced PL/SQL gold certification. The final area, of course, in learning path that you'll see is the Application Express Workshop 1 and 2 and the Applicant Express Administration.

You'll note here the first ones, of course, deal with more developmental, when I'm working with it, developing here your application. And, of course, the Administration would be the maintenance of it. And there is, of course, a certification process or a pathway for this one as well.

That does it here. That completes here this learning Oracle Database Developer Explorer learning path. You've completed that successfully here. And if you're interested in going into and becoming an Oracle Database developer, you can certainly click on the link where it says Here.
