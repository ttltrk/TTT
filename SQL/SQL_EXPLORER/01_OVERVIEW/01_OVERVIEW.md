### 01_OVERVIEW

---

In this learning path, I'm going to guide you down the Explorer learning path on how to get started with Oracle SQL. In this learning path, we're going to be covering three important topics. First, what is SQL, second, what is Relational Database Management System concepts, and third, writing SQL statements.

But before we get there, first look at a brief history of SQL. In the year 1970 here, Dr. EF Codd publishes a paper titled A Relational Model for Data For Large Shared Databanks. This became, then, the guiding light here for relational databases. Then in the mid '70s, IBM developed the Structured English Query Language, known as SEQUEL, which later became SQL, shorter name, S-Q-L. And it's still pronounced, of course, SEQUEL.

Then, in 1979, a company by the name of Relational Software Incorporated, now known as Oracle, introduced first commercially available implementation of SQL. Of course, today, now SQL is accepted as the standard RDBMS hear language. Features of SQL first are, it's an ANSI standard language for operating your relational databases. It's also efficient and very easy to learn and use, and it's functionally complete.

With SQL, you can define, retrieve, and manipulate all data within your database tables. You'll find that this learning path will be very useful for all users involved in developing applications that use SQL, including developers, database administrators, database designers, and support engineers. So what's next? Well, what you get to do is you get to sit back, enjoy this training, and earn your Oracle Database Explorer badge.
