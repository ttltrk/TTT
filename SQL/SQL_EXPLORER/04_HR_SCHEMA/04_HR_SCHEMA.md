### 04_HR_SCHEMA

---

```

```

In this Explorer Learning Path, we're going to examine the HR Resources schema. We're going to look at human resources application interface, and then we're going to study the payables structure and the data inside of the HR schema that is utilized for our demos.

Starting off with this, the slide shows a sample of an HR application which could be used here by the HR department organization. It consists of, of course, information to where a manager could glean information from various tables such as employees, departments, jobs, locations, et cetera. In this one here, the HR manager would use his application to perform searches here to update employee records, add new employees, or remove employees who have quit.

Now, looking specifically, AG, at the HR schema, you'll note here, of course, this is a good diagram of the tables and how they are related to each other. First one, of course, is the Employees table, and it contains information about all of our employees including first_name, last_name, hire_date salary, et cetera. Next table, of course, is departments, and it has department_id and department_name. Next one is locations. Of course, location has location_id, street_address, city, country, and so forth.

And countries, of course, is the country_id right here, which is listed as a relation in the Locations table. And, of course, we also see the country_name name and so forth. Regions is next. It simply has only region_id and region_name. We see the job_grades are there, and, of course, it shows a grade_level and low salary and high salary ranges.

Job history, of course, has an employee_id, starting and end date, maybe jobs when they switched, and so forth. And last but not least, of course, we have the jobs, which is a listing of the job_id's, the name of that job, and minimum and maximum salaries for those job_id's or job titles.
