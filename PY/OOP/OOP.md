```
Python is an object oriented programming language.
Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
```

- Create a Class

```
To create a class, use the keyword class
Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x and y
```

```py
class MyClass:

  x = 5
  y = 10
```

- Create Object

```
Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects
Create an object named p1, and print the value of x and y
```

```py
class MyClass:

  x = 5
  y = 10  

p1 = MyClass()

print(p1.x)
print(p1.y)

>>>
5
10
>>>
```
