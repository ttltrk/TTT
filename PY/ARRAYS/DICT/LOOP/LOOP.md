#### Loop Through a Dictionary

You can loop through a dictionary by using a for loop.

When looping through a dictionary, the return value are the keys of the dictionary, but there are methods to return the values as well.

```py
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict:
  print(x)

>>>
brand
model
year
>>>
```

Print all values in the dictionary, one by one

```py
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict:
  print(thisdict[x])

>>>
Ford
Mustang
1964
>>>
```

```py
