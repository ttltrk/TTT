#### 3212_WHILE_1

##### Looping your code with while

Do you agree with the statement presented below?

```py
while there is something to do
    do it
```

Note that this record also declares that if there is nothing to do, nothing at all will happen.

In general, in Python, a loop can be represented as follows:

```py
while conditional_expression:
    instruction
```

If you notice some similarities to the if instruction, that's quite all right. Indeed, the syntactic difference is only one: you use the word while instead of the word if.

The semantic difference is more important: when the condition is met, if performs its statements only once; while repeats the execution as long as the condition evaluates to True.

Note: all the rules regarding indentation are applicable here, too. We'll show you this soon.
