- Questions and answers

A programmer writes a program and the program asks questions.

A computer executes the program and provides the answers. The program must be able to react according to the received answers.

Fortunately, computers know only two kinds of answers:

- yes, this is true;
- no, this is false.

You will never get a response like Let me think...., I don't know, or Probably yes, but I don't know for sure.

To ask questions, Python uses a set of very special operators. Let's go through them one after another, illustrating their effects on some simple examples.

- Comparison: equality operator

Question: are two values equal?

To ask this question, you use the ```==``` (equal equal) operator.

Don't forget this important distinction:

```
- = is an assignment operator, e.g., a = b assigns a with the value of b;
- == is the question are these values equal?; a == b compares a and b.
```

It is a binary operator with left-sided binding. It needs two arguments and checks if they are equal.
