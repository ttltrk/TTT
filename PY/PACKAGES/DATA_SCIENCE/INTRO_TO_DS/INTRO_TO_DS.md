##### What is data science?

- Data science is a process, not an event.
It is the process of using data
to understand different things,
to understand the world.
- For me, it's when you have a model,
or a hypothesis of a problem,
and you try to validate that hypothesis or model
with your data.
- Data science is the art of uncovering
the insights and trends that are hiding behind data.
- It's when you translate data into a story,
so you use the storytelling to generate insights.
And with these insights,
you can make strategic...
choices for a company or institution.
- Data science is a field about processes and systems,
to extract data from various forms,
whether it is an unstructured or structured form.
- Data science is the study of data,
like biological sciences are the study of biology;
physical sciences, it's the study of physical reactions.
Data is real, data has real properties,
and we need to study them,
if we're gonna work on them.
- Data science involves data and some science.
The definition, or the name,
came up in the 80s and 90s when some professors
were looking into the statistics curriculum,
and they thought it would be better to call it data science.
But what is data science?
I see data science as one's attempt to work with data
to find answers to questions that they are exploring.
In a nutshell, it's more about data
than it is about science.
If you have data, and you have curiosity,
and you're working with data,
and you're manipulating it,
you're exploring it,
the very exercise of going through analyzing data,
trying to get some answers from it, is data science.
Data science is relevant today
because we have tons of data available.
We used to worry about lack of data;
now we have a data deluge.
In the past, we didn't have algorithms;
now we have algorithms.
In the past, the software was expensive;
now it's open source and free.
In the past, we couldn't store large amounts of data;
now, for a fraction of the cost,
we can have gazillions of data sets for very low costs,
so the tools to work with data,
the very availability of data,
and the ability to store and analyze data,
it's all cheap, it's all available,
it's all ubiquitous, it's here.
There's never been a better time to be a data scientist.

##### There are many paths to data science

- Data science didn't really exist when I was growing up.
It's not something that I ever woke up
and said, "I want to be a data scientist when I grow up."
No, it didn't exist.
I didn't know I would be working in data science.
- When I grew up there wasn't
that field called data science.
And I think it's really new.
- Data science didn't exist until 2009, 2011.
Someone like DJ Patil or Andrew Gelman coined the term.
Before that there was statistics
and I didn't want to be any of those.
I wanted to be in business and
then I found data science a heck of a lot more interesting.
- I studied statistics, that's how I started.
I went through many different stages
in my life where I wanted to be a singer
and then a doctor and then I realized
that I was good at math.
So I chose an area that was focusing
quantitative analysis and from then
I do think that I wanted to work with data
not necessarily, data science as it's known today.
- The first time that I had contact with data science,
was when I was in my first year of mechanical engineering.
Strategical consulting firms,
they use data science to make decisions.
So, that was my first contact with data science.
- I had a complicated problem that I needed solved.
The usual techniques that we had at the time
couldn't help with the problem.
- I graduated with a math degree in the worst
possible time right after the economic crisis.
You actually had to be useful to get a job.
So I went and got a degree in statistics
and then I worked enough jobs that were
called data scientist that I suddenly became one.
- My undergraduate degree was in business
and I majored in politics, philosophy and economics.
And then I did a Masters in Business Analytics
at New York University at the Stern School of Business.
When I left my undergrad, the first company I joined,
it turned out that they were analyzing
electronic point of sale data for retail manufacturers.
And what we were doing was data science
but we only really started using that term much later.
In fact, I would say, four or five years ago
is when we started calling it analytics and data science.
- I had several options for my internship here in Canada
and one of the options was to work with data science.
I used to work in product development
but I think that was a good choice.
And then I started my internship with data science.
- I'm a civil engineer by training,
so all engineers work with data.
I would say the conventional use of data science
in my life started with transportation research.
I started building large models trying
to forecast traffic on streets,
trying to determine congestion
and greenhouse gas emissions or tailpipe emissions.
I think that's where my start was
and I started building these models when I was
a graduate student at the University of Toronto.
I started working with very large data sets
looking at household samples of 150,000 households,
half a million trips and that too,
I'm speaking from mid-nineties,
when this was supposed to be a very large data set
but not in today's terms but that's how I started.
I continued working with it and then I moved
to McGill University where I was a professor
of transportation engineering and I built
even bigger data models that involved data and analytics.
So I would say, yes transportation research
brought me to data science.

##### Any advice for new data scientist

- My advice to an aspiring data scientist is to be curious,
extremely argumentative,
judgmental.
Curiosity is absolutely must.
If you're not curious,
you would not know what to do with the data.
Judgmental because if you do not have
preconceived notions about things,
you wouldn't know where to begin.
Argumentative because if you can argue
then you can plead a case,
at least you can start somewhere.
And then you learn from data
and then you modify your assumptions and hypothesis,
and your data would help you learn.
And you may start at the wrong point,
you may say that I thought I believed this
but now with data I know this,
so this allows you a learning process.
So curiosity, being able to take a position,
strong position, and then moving forward with it.
The other thing that a data scientist would need is
some comfort and flexibility with analytics platforms.
Some software, some computing platform but that's secondary.
The most important thing is curiosity
and the ability to take positions.
Once you have done that,
once you've analyzed, then you've got some answers.
And that's the last thing that a data scientist needs
and that is the ability to tell a story.
That once you have your analytics,
once you have your tabulations,
now you should be able to tell a great story from it.
Because if you don't tell a great story from it,
your findings will remain hidden,
it will remain buried, nobody would know,
but your rise to prominence is pretty much relying on your
ability to tell great stories.
A starting point would be to see
what is your competitive advantage?
Do you want to be a data scientist in any field
or a specific field because
let's say you want to be a data scientist and work for an
IT firm or a web-based or internet-based firm.
Then you need a different set of skills.
And if you want to be a data scientist for
let's say in the health industry,
then you need different sets of skills.
So figure out first what your interest is
and what is your competitive advantage.
Your competitive advantage is not
necessarily going to be your analytical skills.
Your competitive advantage is your understanding of
some aspect of life where you exceed
beyond others in understanding that.
Maybe it's film, maybe it's retail,
maybe it's health, maybe it's computers.
Once you have figured out where your expertise lies,
then you start acquiring analytical skills,
what platforms to learn.
And those platforms, those tools would be specific to the
industry that you're interested in.
And then once you have got some proficiency in the tools,
the next thing would be to apply your skills to
real problems and then tell rest of the world
what you can do with it.
