#### MODULE_1

##### What is data science?

- Data science is a process, not an event.
It is the process of using data
to understand different things,
to understand the world.
- For me, it's when you have a model,
or a hypothesis of a problem,
and you try to validate that hypothesis or model
with your data.
- Data science is the art of uncovering
the insights and trends that are hiding behind data.
- It's when you translate data into a story,
so you use the storytelling to generate insights.
And with these insights,
you can make strategic...
choices for a company or institution.
- Data science is a field about processes and systems,
to extract data from various forms,
whether it is an unstructured or structured form.
- Data science is the study of data,
like biological sciences are the study of biology;
physical sciences, it's the study of physical reactions.
Data is real, data has real properties,
and we need to study them,
if we're gonna work on them.
- Data science involves data and some science.
The definition, or the name,
came up in the 80s and 90s when some professors
were looking into the statistics curriculum,
and they thought it would be better to call it data science.
But what is data science?
I see data science as one's attempt to work with data
to find answers to questions that they are exploring.
In a nutshell, it's more about data
than it is about science.
If you have data, and you have curiosity,
and you're working with data,
and you're manipulating it,
you're exploring it,
the very exercise of going through analyzing data,
trying to get some answers from it, is data science.
Data science is relevant today
because we have tons of data available.
We used to worry about lack of data;
now we have a data deluge.
In the past, we didn't have algorithms;
now we have algorithms.
In the past, the software was expensive;
now it's open source and free.
In the past, we couldn't store large amounts of data;
now, for a fraction of the cost,
we can have gazillions of data sets for very low costs,
so the tools to work with data,
the very availability of data,
and the ability to store and analyze data,
it's all cheap, it's all available,
it's all ubiquitous, it's here.
There's never been a better time to be a data scientist.

##### There are many paths to data science

- Data science didn't really exist when I was growing up.
It's not something that I ever woke up
and said, "I want to be a data scientist when I grow up."
No, it didn't exist.
I didn't know I would be working in data science.
- When I grew up there wasn't
that field called data science.
And I think it's really new.
- Data science didn't exist until 2009, 2011.
Someone like DJ Patil or Andrew Gelman coined the term.
Before that there was statistics
and I didn't want to be any of those.
I wanted to be in business and
then I found data science a heck of a lot more interesting.
- I studied statistics, that's how I started.
I went through many different stages
in my life where I wanted to be a singer
and then a doctor and then I realized
that I was good at math.
So I chose an area that was focusing
quantitative analysis and from then
I do think that I wanted to work with data
not necessarily, data science as it's known today.
- The first time that I had contact with data science,
was when I was in my first year of mechanical engineering.
Strategical consulting firms,
they use data science to make decisions.
So, that was my first contact with data science.
- I had a complicated problem that I needed solved.
The usual techniques that we had at the time
couldn't help with the problem.
- I graduated with a math degree in the worst
possible time right after the economic crisis.
You actually had to be useful to get a job.
So I went and got a degree in statistics
and then I worked enough jobs that were
called data scientist that I suddenly became one.
- My undergraduate degree was in business
and I majored in politics, philosophy and economics.
And then I did a Masters in Business Analytics
at New York University at the Stern School of Business.
When I left my undergrad, the first company I joined,
it turned out that they were analyzing
electronic point of sale data for retail manufacturers.
And what we were doing was data science
but we only really started using that term much later.
In fact, I would say, four or five years ago
is when we started calling it analytics and data science.
- I had several options for my internship here in Canada
and one of the options was to work with data science.
I used to work in product development
but I think that was a good choice.
And then I started my internship with data science.
- I'm a civil engineer by training,
so all engineers work with data.
I would say the conventional use of data science
in my life started with transportation research.
I started building large models trying
to forecast traffic on streets,
trying to determine congestion
and greenhouse gas emissions or tailpipe emissions.
I think that's where my start was
and I started building these models when I was
a graduate student at the University of Toronto.
I started working with very large data sets
looking at household samples of 150,000 households,
half a million trips and that too,
I'm speaking from mid-nineties,
when this was supposed to be a very large data set
but not in today's terms but that's how I started.
I continued working with it and then I moved
to McGill University where I was a professor
of transportation engineering and I built
even bigger data models that involved data and analytics.
So I would say, yes transportation research
brought me to data science.

##### Any advice for new data scientist

- My advice to an aspiring data scientist is to be curious,
extremely argumentative,
judgmental.
Curiosity is absolutely must.
If you're not curious,
you would not know what to do with the data.
Judgmental because if you do not have
preconceived notions about things,
you wouldn't know where to begin.
Argumentative because if you can argue
then you can plead a case,
at least you can start somewhere.
And then you learn from data
and then you modify your assumptions and hypothesis,
and your data would help you learn.
And you may start at the wrong point,
you may say that I thought I believed this
but now with data I know this,
so this allows you a learning process.
So curiosity, being able to take a position,
strong position, and then moving forward with it.
The other thing that a data scientist would need is
some comfort and flexibility with analytics platforms.
Some software, some computing platform but that's secondary.
The most important thing is curiosity
and the ability to take positions.
Once you have done that,
once you've analyzed, then you've got some answers.
And that's the last thing that a data scientist needs
and that is the ability to tell a story.
That once you have your analytics,
once you have your tabulations,
now you should be able to tell a great story from it.
Because if you don't tell a great story from it,
your findings will remain hidden,
it will remain buried, nobody would know,
but your rise to prominence is pretty much relying on your
ability to tell great stories.
A starting point would be to see
what is your competitive advantage?
Do you want to be a data scientist in any field
or a specific field because
let's say you want to be a data scientist and work for an
IT firm or a web-based or internet-based firm.
Then you need a different set of skills.
And if you want to be a data scientist for
let's say in the health industry,
then you need different sets of skills.
So figure out first what your interest is
and what is your competitive advantage.
Your competitive advantage is not
necessarily going to be your analytical skills.
Your competitive advantage is your understanding of
some aspect of life where you exceed
beyond others in understanding that.
Maybe it's film, maybe it's retail,
maybe it's health, maybe it's computers.
Once you have figured out where your expertise lies,
then you start acquiring analytical skills,
what platforms to learn.
And those platforms, those tools would be specific to the
industry that you're interested in.
And then once you have got some proficiency in the tools,
the next thing would be to apply your skills to
real problems and then tell rest of the world
what you can do with it.

##### What is the cloud?

- Cloud is a, it's a godsend for data scientists.
Primarily because you're able to take the,
or you take your data, take your information
and put it in the cloud,
put it in the central storage system.
It allows you to bypass the physical limitations
of the computers and the systems you're using
and it allows you to deploy the analytics
and storage capacities of advanced machines
that do not necessarily have to be your machine
or your company's machine.
Cloud allows you not just to store large amounts of data
on servers somewhere in California or in Nevada,
but it also allows you to deploy very advanced
computing algorithms and the ability to do
high performance computing
using machines that are not yours.
So, think of it as you have some information,
you can't store it, so you send it to storage space,
let's call it cloud, and the algorithms that you need to use
you don't have them with you, but then on the cloud
you have those algorithms available.
So, what you do, is you deploy those algorithms
on very large data sets and you're able to do it
even though your own systems, your own machines,
your own computing environments
were not allowing you to do so.
So, cloud is beautiful.
And, the other thing that cloud is beautiful for
is that it allows multiple entities
to work with same data at the same time.
So, you can be working with the same data
that your colleagues in, say, Germany,
and another team in India, and another team in Ghana,
they are collectively working
and they are able to do so because the information
and the algorithms and the tools and the answers
and the results, whatever they needed
is available at a central place.
Which we call cloud, so cloud is beautiful.
At the Big Data University which is an IBM initiative,
we have these courses people can take
and learn about data science,
but at the same time we provide this cloud based environment
for not only analytics,
but also for working with big and small data.
So one of the products that is integrated
with Big Data University is Data Scientist Workbench.
Data Scientist Workbench is an internet based solution,
you log in and the moment you log in,
you now have access to some
very advanced computing environment.
As simple as R and Rstudio and data
and algorithms to define the data set using OpenRefine,
but also the ability to work with very large data sets
using technologies like Spark.
So, the advantage of working with Data Scientist Workbench
is not only that you have the ability to work with
these advanced algorithms and two computing platforms,
but you also have the ability to work with
very large data sets because Spark
is integrated and it's all in the cloud,
you don't have to maintain it,
you don't have to download it,
you don't have to worry about updating it.
All is being done for you in the cloud
by the Data Scientist Workbench.

#### MODULE_2

##### A day in the life of a data science person

- I've built a recommendation engine before
as part of a large organization and worked
through all types of engineers and accounted
for different parts of the problem.
It's one of the one's I'm most happy with
because ultimately I came up with the very simple solution
that was easy to understand from all levels,
from the executives to the engineers and developers.
Ultimately it was just as efficient
as something really complex that I could have
spent a lot more time on.
- Back in the university we have a problem
that we wanted to predict algal bloom.
This algae bloom could cause rising toxicity of the water
and it could cause problems to the water treatment company.
We couldn't predict it with our chemical engineering
background so we used artificial neural-networks to predict
when this bloom will occur.
So the water treatment companies could
better handle this problem.
- In Toronto the public transit is operated by
Toronto Transit Commission.
We call them TTC.
It's one of the largest transit authorities
in the region in North America.
And one day they contacted me and said, 'we have a problem'.
And I said okay, what's the problem.
They said, 'well we have complaints data
and we would like to analyze it and we need your help'.
I said fine I'll be very happy to help.
So I said how many complaints do you have?
They said, 'a few'.
I said how many?
'Maybe half a million'.
I said well let's start working with it.
So I got the data and I started analyzing it.
So basically they have done a great job at
keeping the data, some data in tabular format
other was unstructured data.
And in that case tabular data
was when the complaint arrived, who received it,
what was the type of the complaint, was it resolved,
whose fault was it.
And the unstructured part of it
was the exchange of emails and faxes.
So imagine looking at half a million exchanges of emails
and trying to get some answer from it.
So I started working with it
and the first thing I wanted to know is
why would people complain and is there a pattern.
Are there some days where there are
more complaints than others?
And I looked at the data and I analyzed
it in all different formats and I couldn't find
what the impetus for complaints being higher
on a certain day and lower on others.
And it continued for maybe a month of so
and then one day I was getting off the bus in Toronto
and I was still thinking about it
and I stepped out without looking on the ground
and I stepped into a puddle,
puddle of water.
And now I was sort of ankle deep into water
and it was just one foot wet and the other dry
and I was extremely annoyed.
And I was walking back and then it hit me
and I said well wait a second.
Today it rained unexpectedly and I wasn't prepared for it.
That's why I'm wet and I wasn't looking for it.
What if there's a relationship between
extreme weather and the type of complaints TTC receives?
So I went to the Environment Canada's website
and I got data on rain and precipitation,
wind and the like.
And there I found something very interesting.
The ten most excessive days for complaints,
the ten days were people complain the most
were the days when the weather was bad.
It was unexpected rain, an extreme drop in temperature,
too much snow, a very windy day.
So I went back to the TTC's executives
and I said, I've got good news and bad news.
I said, the good news is I know why people
would complain excessively on certain days.
I know the reason for it.
The bad news is there's nothing you can do about it.

##### R versus Python

As I have an engineering background,
I started programming with C, then I went to Matlab,
and eventually to Python.
I usually use Matlab, C, and C++,
but for data science I use Python.
- R and Python.
- R.
- I'm an R evangelist.
I was at the useR Conference last year
and I think it's got one of the best communities,
I'm also very fond of SQL and I think people don't spend
enough time appreciating it in its various incarnations.
- I primarily work with R and Stata.
I do not work a lot with big data so for the kind
of data sets I have, there are a few million observations,
even the hundreds of millions of observations
then I can work with with the existing Stata and R and SPSS,
I don't have a problem with it,
but as I said, if I were to work with large data sets,
I would use different tools.
My preferred tools are the three; R, Stata, and SPSS.
I also work with spacial data a lot
so these are data sets which have a geographical
component to it, so imagine 40 million Californians
and 40 million people, some of them in California,
some of them in the neighboring states,
and what if I know the exact home address
of each and everyone of them and where they work.
And that would be an amazing GIS,
spacial geographic information systems database.
So I work with those as well and my tool that I use
is called Maptitude and MapInfo,
these are the two I use the most.

##### Data science tools and technology

- I really enjoy regression.
I'd say regression was maybe one of the first concepts that
really helped me understand data, so I enjoy regression.
- I really like data visualization.
I think it's a key element for people to get
across their message to people
that don't understand that well what data science is.
- Artificial neural networks.
- I'm really passionate about neural networks
because we have a lot to learn from nature
so when we are trying to mimic our brain,
I think that we can do some applications with this behavior,
this biological behavior in algorithms.
- Data visualization with R, I love to do this.
- Nearest neighbor, it's the simplest,
but it just gets the best results so many more times,
than some overblown, overworked algorithm
that's just as likely to over fit
as it is to make a good fit.
- So, structured data is more like tabular data,
things that you're familiar with in Microsoft Excel format,
you've got rows and columns,
and that's called structured data.
Unstructured data is basically data that is coming from
mostly from web, where it's not tabular.
It is not in rows and columns, it's text.
Sometimes it's video and audio.
You would have to deploy more sophisticated algorithms
to extract data.
In fact, a lot of times, we take unstructured data
and spend a great deal of time and effort to get
some structure out of it and then analyze it.
If you have something which just fits nicely into
tables and columns and rows go ahead.
That's your structured data,
but if you see if it's a weblog,
or if you're trying to get information out of webpages,
and you've got a gazillion webpages,
that's unstructured data,
that would require a little bit more effort
to get information out of it.
Machine learning is basically a set of these advanced tools
people use to find answers.
I'm not a big fan of machine learning,
and I'll give you my bias right now.
Imagine there's an island
and there are about 45,000 people who live on that island.
It's cut off from the rest of the world,
nobody can swim into the island, or swim out of the island.
Now imagine that island had a murder,
and you're the detective who's been tasked
with finding who the culprit is.
Now, there's various approaches you can take.
One approach is you say, well, whoever killed this person
is on this island.
So there are 45,000 people and there are 45,000 suspects.
I'm going to go one by one asking each person
until I find the suspect, right.
That's machine learning, because you have no other reason,
no other assumptions, no other hypothesis, no other feeling.
You say, I don't know anything.
I'm just going to throw everything into my model
and see who the culprit is.
Sometimes you get to the culprit, sometimes you don't,
but it would take time.
Machine learning is basically saying when you do not have
many assumptions about your data, and you're short of
knowing a lot about your data,
you just throw everything into this model,
and see what comes out of it.
It's more of a black box approach.
I know that a large number of professionals live by it.
I, on the other hand, like to look at data with my own
preconceived notions, because it is said, a data scientist
is someone who is very judgmental.
That person, a data scientist is one who has an opinion
about data.
Who has an opinion about the phenomena they're learning,
or they're investigating.
They cannot simply believe
that I'm going to have a kitchen sink approach,
I'm going to dump everything in the model.
Machine learning is basically saying, dump everything,
see what comes out of it.
There are thousands of books written on regression,
and millions of lectures delivered on regression.
And I always feel that they don't do a good job
of explaining regression, because they get into data
and models and statistical distributions.
Let's forget about it, let me explain regression
in the simplest possible terms.
If you have ever taken a cab ride, a taxi ride,
you understand regression.
Here's how it works.
The moment you sit in a cab ride, in a cab,
you see that there's a fixed amount there, it says 2 dollars 50 cents, $2.50
You rather that the cab moves or you get off,
this is what you owe to the driver,
the moment you step into a cab.
That's a constant, you have to pay that amount,
if you have stepped into a cab.
Then as it starts moving, for every meter or 100 meters,
the fare increases by a certain amount.
So, there's a fraction, there's a relationship
between distance and the amount you would pay,
above and beyond that constant.
If you're not moving, and you're stuck in traffic,
then every additional minute, you have to pay more.
As the minutes increase, your fare increases,
as the distance increases, your fare increases,
and while all this is happening, you've already
paid a base fare, which is the constant.
This is what regression is.
Regression tells you what the base fare is
and what is the relationship between time
and the fare you have paid
and the distance you have traveled
and the fare you have paid.
Because in the absence of knowing those relationships,
and just knowing how much people traveled for,
and how much they paid,
regression allows you to compute
that constant that you didn't know it was 2.50,
and it would compute the relationship between the fare
and the distance, and the fare and the time.
That's a regression.

#### MODULE_3

##### How should companies get started in Data Science

At the end of the day, for businesses,
they know one thing, that if they are unable to measure
something, they are unable to improve it.
And if they are unable to measure their costs,
they are unable to reduce them.
If they are unable to measure their profits,
they are unable to increase them.
So the first thing a company has to do
is to start recording information, start capturing data.
Data about costs, data about.. and then differentiated
by labor costs and material costs.
The cost to, how much it costs to sell one product
and the total cost.
And then you look at the revenue.
Where is your revenue coming from?
Is 80% of your revenue coming from 20% of your customers?
Or is it the other way around?
So first thing first, start capturing data.
Once you have data, then you can apply algorithms
and analytics to it.
So the first thing to do would be to capture data.
If you're not capturing it, start capturing it.
If you're capturing it, archive it.
Do not overwrite on your old data
thinking you don't need it anymore.
Data never gets old, data is always relevant.
Even if it's a hundred years old, 200 years old,
it is relevant to you and your firm and your success.
So keep data, capture it, archive it.
Make sure nothing goes to waste.
Make sure there's a consistency
so someone 20 years later trying to understand
that data should be able to do so.
So have proper documentation.
Do it now, put the best practices for data archiving
in place the moment you start a business.
And if you're already in business
and you haven't done it, do it now.
- Start measuring things.
Too many companies haven't measured things properly
for a decade and then they decide they want data science.
Data science inside a company
is only going to be as valuable as the data collected.
Garbage in, garbage out is a rule in any sort of analysis.
- If something is not measured,
it's very difficult to improve it or to change it.
So the very first step is measurement.
If companies have existing data,
then they should start looking at it and cleaning it.
If they don't have existing data,
then they need to start collecting it.
- I think to look for a team who love to work
as a data scientist.
- The first step is to have employees,
that they are interested in science.
Cause if you don't have interest in your company,
you will not have like engagement.
- Companies should remember that it's key
to have a team, so it's not one data scientist
but a team of them, that each of them have strengths
in different areas of data science.

##### Recruiting for data science

- When the companies are hiring
people for a data science team,
maybe a data scientist or an analyst,
or a chief data scientist,
the tendency would be to find the person
who has all the skills,
that they know the domain specific knowledge,
they are excellent in analyzing structured
and unstructured data,
and they are great at presenting,
and they've got great storytelling skills.
So if you'll put all this together,
you will realize you're looking for a unicorn,
and your odds of finding a unicorn are pretty rare.
I think what you need to do is to see,
given the pool of applicants you have,
who has the most resonance with your firm's DNA.
Because, see, you can teach analytic skills.
Anyone can learn analytic skills
if they would dedicate time and effort to it.
But what really matters is who is passionate
about the kind of business that you do.
Someone could be a great data scientist
in the retail environment,
but they may not be that exited about
working in IT-related firms,
or working with gigabytes of web logs.
But if someone is excited about those web logs,
or someone is excited about health-related data,
then they would be able to contribute
to your productivity much more so.
And I would say if I'm looking for someone,
if I have to put together a data science team,
I would first look for curiosity.
Is that person curious about things?
Not just for data science, but anything.
Are they curious about why this room
is painted a certain way?
Why the bookshelves have books and what kind of books?
They have to have a certain degree of curiosity
about everything that is in their vision
that they look at.
The second thing is, do they have a sense of humor?
Because you see, you have to have lighthearted about it.
If someone is too serious about it,
they probably would take it too seriously,
and would not be able to look at the lighter elements.
The third thing I think,
and I think the last that I would look for,
if I have to have a hierarchy,
the last thing I would look for are technical skills.
I would go through these social skills,
curiosity, sense of humor, the ability to tell a story,
the ability to know that there is a story there.
And then once all is there,
then I will say,
"Well, can you do the technical side of it?"
And if there is some hope
or some sign of some technical skills,
I would take them because I can train them
in whatever skills they need.
But I cannot teach curiosity.
I cannot teach storytelling.
I cannot certainly instill sense of humor in anyone.
- I think there's no hard and fast rule
for hiring data scientists.
I think it's gonna be a case by case thing.
I would say there has to be some sort of
technical component.
Somebody should be able to manipulate the data.
They should be able to communicate
what they find in the data.
I find quite often, nobody really cares about the
R squared or confidence interval.
So you have to be able to introduce those things
and explain something in a compelling way.
And they also have to find somebody who is relatable,
because data science, it being typically new means that
the person in that role has to make relationships
and they have to work across different departments.
- If this data scientist has a good mathematics
and statistic background.
- They have to consider problem solving abilities
and analysis.
A data scientist needs to be good in analyzing problems.
- The persons they are hiring,
they should love to play with data,
and then they know how to play with the data visualization.
They have analytical thinking.
- When a company is hiring,
anyone to work on a data science team,
they need to think about what role that person
is going to take.
Before a company begins, they need to understand
what they want out of their data science team.
And then they need to hire to begin it.
As they grow a data science team,
they need to understand whether they need
engineers, architects, designers to work on visualization,
or whether they just need more people
who can multiply large matrices.
- From a skills point, let's focus on the technical skills,
and in that case, first thing would be
what kind of technical platform would you like to adopt.
Let's say you wanna work in a structured data environment,
and let's say you wanna work in market research.
Then the type of skills you need are slightly different
than someone who would like to work
in big data environments.
If you wanna work in the traditional market research
structured data environment,
your skills should be some statistical knowledge,
some knowledge of basic statistical algorithms,
maybe some machine learning algorithms,
and these are the tools that you would like to develop.
If you wanna work in big data,
then there's the other aspect of it,
and that is to be able to store data.
So you start with the expertise
in storing large amounts of data,
and then you look into platforms that allow you to do that.
The next step would be able to manipulate
large amounts of data,
and the final step would be to apply
algorithms to those large sets of data.
So it's a three-step process,
but most likely it starts...
Most importantly, it starts with where you would like to be,
in what field, in what domain.
So, in terms of platforms,
let's say you wanna be in a traditional
predictive analytics environment,
and you're not working with big data,
then R, or Stata, or Python would be your tools.
If you're working mostly with unstructured data,
then Python is more suitable than R.
If you're working with big data, then Hadoop and Spark
are the environments that you will be working with.
So it all depends upon where you would like to be,
and what kind of work excites you,
and then you pick your tools.
In additional to technical skills,
the second aspect of the data science
is to have the ability communicate,
the communication skills or presentation skills.
I call them storytelling skills.
That is that you have your analysis done,
now can you tell a great story from it?
If you have a very large table,
can you synthesize this and make it more appealing
that when it goes on the screen,
or is it part of document that it just speaks,
it sings the findings,
and the reader just gets it right there?
So, the ability to present your findings,
either verbally, or in a presentation,
or in a document,
so that communication and presentation skills
are equally important as the technical skills are.
When you have a great insight,
and when you're presenting your results...
Imagine you're driving on a mountain
and then there's a sharp turn,
and you can't see what's beyond the turn,
and then you make that turn,
and then suddenly you see
a tremendous valley in front of you,
and this great sense of awe that,
"I didn't know that."
Right?
So when you present your findings
and you have this great finding,
and you communicate it well,
this is what people feel because they were not expecting it.
They were not aware of it,
and then this great sense of happiness that,
"Now I know. And I didn't notice. Now I know."
And then it empowers them.
It gives them ideas what they can do with this knowledge,
this new insight.
It's a great sense of joy.
As a data scientist, you're able to share it
with your clients because you enabled it.

##### Applications of data science

- I think one of the good new applications
of data science is in the medical field.
Like in drug delivery or cancer treatment.
- I think a very interesting one
is how now companies can use all the information
they're gathering from their customers
to actually develop new products
that respond to the needs
of the customers.
- A good new application of data science
was the high trending news of Pokémon Go.
So they used Ingress.
They used data of the Ingress app.
The last app of the same company
and they choose the locations
for Pokémons and gyms
according to data from the last app.
So they learned with their errors.
- Google Search is an application of data science.
The Google Search, whenever we want to search anything.
So I think its all because of data science.
Whatever Google is now, it's all because of data science.
- Augmented reality is my favorite
new implementation of data science.
I think you can't look at a new technology
and not see data science in there
but augmented reality is the one
I'm just the most excited about.
The ability to walk around and see things on walls
or around us that aren't really there.
Pokémon's just the start.
- So what has happened is that now the tools are available
and datasets are available,
people are applying them with not much diligence
and I think one of the strange cases
which got reported in the newspapers is about the story
of a father walking into a Target store in the US
and complaining about the fact
that the Target was sending mails to his teenage daughter
about diapers and milk, baby formula.
He was angry with them.
He said, "Why would you like
"for my teenage daughter to have a baby?"
And he was obviously disturbed
by this mail or the ad campaign.
And they obviously apologized
but then the father returned two weeks later
and he apologized to them
saying he didn't know his daughter was pregnant.
Now the question is, how did Target know this thing
before the father knew.
And what has happened is that they would look
at the purchasing behavior of individuals.
So if you're buying some sort of supplements or vitamins
then you know that this is the first trimester of pregnancy.
So they know what products to send to you
assuming that the person
who bought those supplements were pregnant.
Now this is a great story about data science
and how data science can forecast and predict
these consumer behaviors
even before the family would find out.
And I find it disturbing and strange and odd
for a variety of reasons.
First of all, for every correct prediction,
you have hundreds of incorrect predictions
which we call the false positives
and no data scientist actually advertises
his or her false positives.
We only advertise and promote what we got it right.
But when we got it wrong hundreds of times we don't tell it.
Second thing is, that's an abuse of data.
That's basically not really not giving you much insight.
You've just found a correlation
but someone could be purchasing the same material
for someone else.
So, and then the odds of getting it wrong
and the odds of getting false positives is much higher.
So I find it strange and I think it gives a false sense
of our ability to predict the future.
The reality is about data science
and the most important thing
for the budding data scientist to know
that all forecasts are wrong.
They're useful but they're wrong.
And so one should not put their faith
into the fact that now that we can do predictive analytics
that we can solve all problems.
I think a good example is the Google Search.
Google published a paper saying
they can predict flu epidemics
before the Center for Disease Control.
And what they did was they were looking
at what people were searching on Google so flu symptoms.
So Google saw the flu symptom searches
before anybody else and they were able to predict it.
The thing is these searches are good
and they are correlated with some outcomes
but not necessarily all the time.
So at that time, when Google announced,
it was a big thing and everybody really like it
and well that's a new era of predictive analytics.
Only that a few years later they realized
that Google started to predict false positives.
That they were predicting things that were not really there
or the predictions were not that accurate
for a variety or reasons.
They changed probably their algorithms
and the datasets were not really correlated
with the outcomes.
So what's the lesson to learn here?
One has to avoid what we call the data hubris.
That you should not believe in your models too much
because they can lead you astray.
Data science has tremendous potential to bring change
in parts of the world, in parts of our society
that have been disenfranchised for years.
One sees great examples of data science
especially in the developing countries
where they are targeting relief efforts.
They're targeting food
and other aid to individuals,
to places that have not been targeted in the past.
And the reason it is happening now
is the greater availability of data and models and analytics
to be able to pinpoint where the greatest needs are.
The ability to design and conduct experiments
to see if one were to give micro-credits,
small loans to very poor households
in developing parts of the world,
to see how they affect
the individual household's ability to get out a poverty
and also the local community's ability
to collectively improve their economic well-being
by just very small infusions of cash or credit.
So these experiments happening all over the world
are allowing that is a direct result
of our ability to analyze data
and be able to design experiments
and then roll out humongous efforts
in providing relief, providing credit,
providing an opportunity
to those who have been disenfranchised in the past
an opportunity to join the rest of the world
in prosperity and happiness and health.

##### Things data science people say

- Once you have analyzed and you've got your results,
know that your results as wrong,
be a little suspicious of your findings.
Always believe that there is no white and black and white,
it is always some grey matter.
And if you can go back and redo the analysis again and again
until you're absolutely sure that no mistakes were made.
- If it's not being measured,
it doesn't exist.
- I really like the Occam's Razor that if you have
that if states that if you have a problem
with two explanations usually the simplest one the better.
- For me it's like less is more.
Try to simplify things.
- "In God we trust everyone else bring data."
I didn't come up with that,
that was Deming.
I had to look him up.
