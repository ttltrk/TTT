#### INTRO_W3

##### What is NumPy?

NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.
NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

##### Why Use NumPy?

In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.
Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.
Data Science: is a branch of computer science where we study how to store, use and analyze data for deriving information from it.

##### Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?

NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.
This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.
This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures.

##### Which Language is NumPy written in?

NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.

##### Where is the NumPy Codebase?

The source code for NumPy is located at this (github repository)[https://github.com/numpy/numpy]
github: enables many people to work on the same codebase.

#### GETTING_STARTED_W3

##### Import NumPy

Once NumPy is installed, import it in your applications by adding the import keyword:

```py
import numpy
```

```py
import numpy

arr = numpy.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(arr)

>>>
[1 2 3 4 5]
>>>
```

##### NumPy as np

NumPy is usually imported under the np alias.
alias: In Python alias are an alternate name for referring to the same thing.
Create an alias with the as keyword while importing:

```py
import numpy as np
```

Now the NumPy package can be referred to as np instead of numpy.

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(arr)

>>>
[1 2 3 4 5]
>>>
```

##### Checking NumPy Version

The version string is stored under __version__ attribute.

```py
import numpy as np

print(np.__version__)

>>>
1.16.2
>>>
```

#### CREATING_ARRAYS_W3

##### Create a NumPy ndarray Object

NumPy is used to work with arrays. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray.
We can create a NumPy ndarray object by using the array() function.

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(arr)
print(type(arr))

>>>
[1 2 3 4 5]
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
>>>
```

```type()```: This built-in Python function tells us the type of the object passed to it. Like in above code it shows that arr is numpy.ndarray type.

To create an ndarray, we can pass a list, tuple or any array-like object into the array() method, and it will be converted into an ndarray:

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))

print(arr)

>>>
[1 2 3 4 5]
>>>
```

##### Dimensions in Arrays

A dimension in arrays is one level of array depth (nested arrays).
nested array: are arrays that have arrays as their elements.

##### 0-D Arrays

0-D arrays, or Scalars, are the elements in an array. Each value in an array is a 0-D array.

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array(42)

print(arr)

>>>
42
>>>
```

##### 1-D Arrays

An array that has 0-D arrays as its elements is called uni-dimensional or 1-D array.
These are the most common and basic arrays.

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(arr)

>>>
[1 2 3 4 5]
>>>
```

##### 2-D Arrays

An array that has 1-D arrays as its elements is called a 2-D array.
These are often used to represent matrix or 2nd order tensors.

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

print(arr)

>>>
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]
>>>
```

##### 3-D arrays

An array that has 2-D arrays (matrices) as its elements is called 3-D array.
These are often used to represent a 3rd order tensor.

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]])

print(arr)

>>>
[[[1 2 3]
  [4 5 6]]

 [[1 2 3]
  [4 5 6]]]
>>>
```

##### Check Number of Dimensions?

NumPy Arrays provides the ndim attribute that returns an integer that tells us how many dimensions the array have.

```py
import numpy as np

a = np.array(42)
b = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
c = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
d = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]])

print(a.ndim)
print(b.ndim)
print(c.ndim)
print(d.ndim)

>>>
0
1
2
3
>>>
```

##### Higher Dimensional Arrays

An array can have any number of dimensions.
When the array is created, you can define the number of dimensions by using the ndmin argument.

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], ndmin=5)

print(arr)
print('number of dimensions :', arr.ndim)

>>>
[[[[[1 2 3 4]]]]]
number of dimensions : 5
>>>
```

#### ARRAY_INDEXING_W3

##### Access Array Elements

Array indexing is the same as accessing an array element.
You can access an array element by referring to its index number.
The indexes in NumPy arrays start with 0, meaning that the first element has index 0, and the second has index 1 etc.

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])

print(arr[0])
print(arr[1])

>>>
1
2
>>>
```

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])

print(arr[2] + arr[3])

>>>
7
>>>
```

##### Access 2-D Arrays

To access elements from 2-D arrays we can use comma separated integers representing the dimension and the index of the element.

Think of 2-D arrays like a table with rows and columns, where the row represents the dimension and the index represents the column.

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])

print('2nd element on 1st row: ', arr[0, 1])

>>>
2nd element on 1st dim:  2
>>>
```

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])

print('5th element on 2nd row: ', arr[1, 4])

>>>
5th element on 2nd dim:  10
>>>
```

##### Access 3-D Arrays

To access elements from 3-D arrays we can use comma separated integers representing the dimensions and the index of the element.

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])

print(arr[0, 1, 2])
print(arr[1, 1, 1])

>>>
6
11
>>>
```

##### Negative Indexing

Use negative indexing to access an array from the end.

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])

print('Last element from 2nd dim: ', arr[1, -1])

>>>
Last element from 2nd dim:  10
>>>
```

#### ARRAY_SLICING_W3

##### Slicing arrays

Slicing in python means taking elements from one given index to another given index.
We pass slice instead of index like this: ```[start:end]```.
We can also define the step, like this: ```[start:end:step]```.
If we don't pass start its considered 0
If we don't pass end its considered length of array in that dimension
If we don't pass step its considered 1

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])

print(arr[1:5])

>>>
[2 3 4 5]
>>>
```

The result includes the start index, but excludes the end index.

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])

print(arr[4:])
print(arr[:4])

>>>
[5 6 7]
[1 2 3 4]
>>>
```

##### Negative Slicing

Use the minus operator to refer to an index from the end:

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])

print(arr[-3:-1])

>>>
[5 6]
>>>
```

##### STEP

Use the step value to determine the step of the slicing:

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])

print(arr[1:5:2])

>>>
[2 4]
>>>
```

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])

print(arr[::2])

>>>
[1 3 5 7]
>>>
```

##### Slicing 2-D Arrays

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])

print(arr[1, 1:4])

>>>
[7 8 9]
>>>
```

From both elements, return index 2:

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])

print(arr[0:2, 2])

>>>
[3 8]
>>>
```

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]])

print(arr[0:2, 1:4])

>>>
[[2 3 4]
 [7 8 9]]
>>>
```

#### NP_DATA_TYPES_W3

##### Data Types in Python

By default Python have these data types:

```
- strings - used to represent text data, the text is given under quote marks. e.g. "ABCD"
- integer - used to represent integer numbers. e.g. -1, -2, -3
- float - used to represent real numbers. e.g. 1.2, 42.42
- boolean - used to represent True or False.
- complex - used to represent complex numbers. e.g. 1.0 + 2.0j, 1.5 + 2.5j
```

##### Data Types in NumPy

NumPy has some extra data types, and refer to data types with one character, like i for integers, u for unsigned integers etc.

Below is a list of all data types in NumPy and the characters used to represent them.

```
i - integer
b - boolean
u - unsigned integer
f - float
c - complex float
m - timedelta
M - datetime
O - object
S - string
U - unicode string
V - fixed chunk of memory for other type ( void )
```

#### checking the data type of an array

The NumPy array object has a property called dtype that returns the data type of the array.

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])

print(arr.dtype)

>>>
int32
>>>
```

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'])

print(arr.dtype)

>>>
<U6
>>>
```

#### Creating Arrays With a Defined Data Type

We use the array() function to create arrays, this function can take an optional argument: dtype that allows us to define the expected data type of the array elements

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype='S')

print(arr)
print(arr.dtype)

>>>
[b'1' b'2' b'3' b'4']
|S1
>>>
```

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype='i4')

print(arr)
print(arr.dtype)

>>>
[1 2 3 4]
int32
>>>
```

#### Converting Data Type on Existing Arrays

The best way to change the data type of an existing array, is to make a copy of the array with the astype() method.
The astype() function creates a copy of the array, and allows you to specify the data type as a parameter.
The data type can be specified using a string, like 'f' for float, 'i' for integer etc. or you can use the data type directly like float for float and int for integer.

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1.1, 2.1, 3.1])

newarr = arr.astype('i')

print(newarr)
print(newarr.dtype)

>>>
[1 2 3]
int32
>>>
```

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1.1, 2.1, 3.1])

newarr = arr.astype(int)

print(newarr)
print(newarr.dtype)

>>>
[1 2 3]
int32
>>>
```

```py
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 0, 3])

newarr = arr.astype(bool)

print(newarr)
print(newarr.dtype)

>>>
[ True False  True]
bool
>>>
```
