##### Machine learning basics

```
supervised vs unsupervised
regression vs classification
training & evaluating models
```

- Supervised

```
required training data with independent & dependent variables (labelled data)
need labelled data to supervise the algorithm when learning from data

- regression models
- classification models
```
