#### WHAT_IS_ML

```
Machine Learning is a way of taking data and turning it into insights. We use computer power to analyze examples
from the past to build a model that can predict the result for new examples.
```

```
One of the most common languages used by Machine Learning professionals is Python.

- Pandas is used for reading data and data manipulation,
- numpy is used for computations of numerical data,
- matplotlib is used for graphing data,
- scikit-learn is used for machine learning models.
```

```
In Machine Learning, we talk about supervised and unsupervised learning.

- Supervised learning is when we have a known target based on past data (for example,
  predicting what price a house will sell for)  

- Unsupervised learning is when there isn't a known past answer (for example,
  determining the topics discussed in restaurant reviews).
```

```
Within supervised learning, there are classification and regression problems.

- Regression is predicting a numerical value (for example,
  predicting what price a house will sell for) and

- Classification is predicting what class something belongs to (for example,
  predicting if a borrower will default on their loan).
