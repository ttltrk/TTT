### MODULES

---

Consider a module to be the same as a code library.
A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.

---

To create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension ```.py```

```py
#Save this code in a file named mymodule.py

def greeting(name):
  print("Hello, " + name)
```

```py
import mymodule

mymodule.greeting("Jonathan")
```
