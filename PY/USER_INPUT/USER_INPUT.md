#### User Input

Python allows for user input.
That means we are able to ask the user for input.
The method is a bit different in Python 3.6 than Python 2.7.
Python 3.6 uses the input() method.
Python 2.7 uses the raw_input() method.

```py
username = input("Enter username:")
print("Username is: " + username)

>>>
Enter username:trk
Username is: trk
>>>
```
