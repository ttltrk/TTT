#### FILE_HANDLING

```
File handling is an important part of any web application.
Python has several functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.
```

```
The key function for working with files in Python is the open() function.
The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.
There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:

"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist
"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist
"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist
"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists

In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode

"t" - Text - Default value. Text mode
"b" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)
```

```py
f = open("demofile.txt")
```
