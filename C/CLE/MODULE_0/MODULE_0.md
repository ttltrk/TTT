#### MODULE_0

```
Installing and using your programming environment
```

##### Where to begin?

Every creative activity needs tools, and programming is no exception. In its simplest (not to say the most primitive) form, programming requires a sheet of paper and a pencil.

Of course, we’re not going to practice programming like this – it would be quite good practice for writing raw code, but it’s impossible to run and quite impractical. As running the code is the only method of finding out whether it’s correct, programming requires a computer equipped with some additional tools.

In this document, we’ll show you some ways of using your computer as a developer's workstation. However, don't forget that there are many factors affecting actions that must (or mustn’t) be performed: hardware platform, operating system, operating system version, etc. We don’t know your system, so our guide is general. We’ll show you the direction – you’ll have to find solutions yourself.

Unfortunately, all of our suggestions require access to the Internet – either permanent or temporary. You need to download virtually all installation files from the products’ sites. Other tools work on-line only. Sorry, there are no workarounds.

By the way, you can successfully run all our programs and examples without the use of any specialized environment – only by using a standard text editor and command-line compiler tools.

However, we don't recommend it, and that’s why we’re going to use some special applications that will enable us to utilize a range of tools in one place.

Generally, there are two ways in which we can advise you:

using locally installed IDE
using on-line tools

##### What is IDE?

IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that typically consists of a code editor, a compiler, a debugger, and a graphical user interface (GUI) builder.

Programming with an IDE has many advantages: you get a toolkit containing everything you may need. Real programmers usually use an IDE too. An IDE gives you a comfortable desk equipped with all means, supplies and aids.

There are some disadvantages, too. Comfortable desks usually weigh a lot. So do IDEs. They may consume a lot of resources and, frankly speaking, you probably don’t need most of the functions they can perform.

Using on-line tools allows you to write, store and run your code without installing anything. Imagine it as a simplified IDE accessible remotely via the Internet. That means that you need two things: an Internet browser and Internet access.

If you can try both approaches, then choose the one that’s more convenient for you. If you can't – choose the one you can use.
