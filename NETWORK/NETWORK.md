#### SWITCH

- using switch for connect pcs
- cat5, cat6 cable
- optic cable is much faster then copper cable
- we always use cables to connect comps to the switch
- a switch cannot use wireless technology
- if you want the devices in the same env to be connect to each other over wireless technology,
you should use an Access Point

```
Access Points >> wireless
Switches >> Cables
```

- LAN = Local Area Network
- A LAN is a computer network that connects computers within a restricted area such as a residence, school or office
- switch devices have LAN ports
- the pcs are communicating between each other with packets

#### ROUTER

```
the main task of the router is to enable computers to connect to the internet  
```

- a special cable comes to our house and we connect to the internet by using this cable
- this cable is given to us by the ISP (Internet Service Provider)
- there is definitely no need for a router for devices in the same LAN to communicate
- either a switch or an access point device is sufficient for this purpose

```
the device that delivers the packets from the LAN to the internet is the router
