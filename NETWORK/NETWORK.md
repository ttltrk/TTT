#### BASICS

- using switch for connect pcs
- cat5, cat6 cable
- optic cable is much faster then copper cable
- we always use cables to connect comps to the switch
- a switch cannot use wireless technology
- if you want the devices in the same env to be connect to each other over wireless technology,
you should use an Access Point

```
Access Points >> wireless
Switches >> Cables
```

- LAN = Local Area Network
- A LAN is a computer network that connects computers within a restricted area such as a residence, school or office
- switch devices have LAN ports
