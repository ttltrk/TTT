#### SWITCH

- using switch for connect pcs
- cat5, cat6 cable
- optic cable is much faster then copper cable
- we always use cables to connect comps to the switch
- a switch cannot use wireless technology
- if you want the devices in the same env to be connect to each other over wireless technology,
you should use an Access Point

```
Access Points >> wireless
Switches >> Cables
```

- LAN = Local Area Network
- A LAN is a computer network that connects computers within a restricted area such as a residence, school or office
- switch devices have LAN ports
- the pcs are communicating between each other with packets

#### ROUTER

```
the main task of the router is to enable computers to connect to the internet  
```

- a special cable comes to our house and we connect to the internet by using this cable
- this cable is given to us by the ISP (Internet Service Provider)
- there is definitely no need for a router for devices in the same LAN to communicate
- either a switch or an access point device is sufficient for this purpose

```
the device that delivers the packets from the LAN to the internet is the router
```

#### INTERNET

```
Connecting to the internet can stand for connecting to the another computer in anywhere in the world
The structure that connects all LANs in the world is the internet
```

```
A home-router is a combo device that is a mixture of router and switch
Most home-routers nowadays also have an access point feature. In this way, you can use wireless technology as well if you want.
```

- if we give entire the load to the single point, we call this problem 'Single Point of Failure'
- mess is minimized since not many cables are connected to routers in the distributed structure
- all the underwater cables are fiber optic cables  
- each router must have a special table called 'routing table', this table tells us which route the packet should choose

```
forwarding

the router learns the packets destination then it looks at the routing table and learns over
which port the packet will be sent
```

```
routers have a special processor inside. these processors create routing tables by using
special algorithms
```

- a router always wants to deliver the packets to its destination in the fastest way possible
