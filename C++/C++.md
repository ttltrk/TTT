#### SYNTAX

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}

>>>
Hello World!
--------------------------------
Process exited after 1.515 seconds with return value 0
Press any key to continue . . .
>>>
```

- Line 1: #include <iostream> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as cout (used in line 5). Header files add functionality to C++ programs.
- Line 2: using namespace std means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.
Don't worry if you don't understand how #include <iostream> and using namespace std works. Just think of it as something that (almost) always appears in your program.
- Line 3: A blank line. C++ ignores white space.
- Line 4: Another thing that always appear in a C++ program, is int main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
- Line 5: cout (pronounced "see-out") is an object used together with the insertion operator (<<) to output/print text. In our example it will output "Hello World".
Note: Every C++ statement ends with a semicolon ;.

```
Note: The body of int main() could also been written as:
int main () { cout << "Hello World! "; return 0; }
```

Remember: The compiler ignores white spaces. However, multiple lines makes the code more readable.
- Line 6: return 0 ends the main function.
- Line 7: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket } to actually end the main function.
