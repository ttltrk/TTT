#### WHAT_IS_BLOCKCHAIN

Blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.

Inside the block

```
1. Data: "Hello World"
2. Prev hash: 034DFA357
3. Hash: 4D56E1F05
```

Blockchain
Blocks are cryptographically linked together

```
1. Genesis Block
  - data: "blabla"
  - prev hash: no because it is a first block
  - hash: 034DFA357

2. Second Block
  - data: "hehehehe"
  - prev hash: 034DFA357
  - hash: 4D56E1F05

3. Third Block
  - data: "xoxoxo"
  - prev hash: 4D56E1F05
  - hash: 77UYT83RE
```

#### SHA256

NSA developed the SHA256

```
256 bit
64 char
digits and chars = hexadecimal

every char = 4 bit
64x4=256
```
