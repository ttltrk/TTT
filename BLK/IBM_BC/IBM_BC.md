#### MODULE_1

##### What is blockchain?

Business networks today are often inefficient because each participant in the network keeps records, or a ledger, of all transactions between all the parties that the business interacts with. This process is expensive because of duplication of effort and intermediaries adding costs for their services.

One solution to this problem is blockchain, which provides a shared ledger technology that allows any participant in the network to see the one system of record, or ledger. By using blockchain technology, businesses can benefit from a more efficient transfer of goods and services.

The video in this module describes the business context of blockchain, the problems that blockchain can solve, what blockchain is and how it works.

- Business Networks benefit from connectivity
  - Participants are customers, suppliers, banks, partners
  - Cross geography and regulatory boundary
- Wealth is generated by the flow of goods and services across business network in
  transactions and contracts
- Markets are central to this process:
  - Public (fruit market, car auction)
  - Private (supply chain financing, bonds)

##### Transferring assets

Anything that is capable of being owned or controlled to produce value, is an asset

Two fundamental type of asset:
- Tangible (House)
- Intangible (Mortgage)

Intangible assets subdivide
- Financial (bond)
- Intellectual (patents)
- Digital (data)

Cash is also an asset
- has property of anonymity

##### Ledgers, Transactions and Contracts

- Ledger: an important log of all transactions, describes the inputs and outputs of the business
- Transaction: an asset transfer between participants (Matt gives a car to Dave (simple))
- Contract: the conditions for a transaction to occur
    - if Dave pays Matt money, then car passes from Matt to Dave (simple)
    - if car won't start, funds do not pass to Matt (as decided by third party arbitrator) (more complex)

##### Different types of blockchain

- All blockchains aim to provide irrefutable proof that a set of transactions occurred between participants
- Different types of blockchain exist:
  - bitcoin is an example of an unpermissioned, public blockchain
    - the first blockchain application
    - defines a shadow-currency and its ledger
    - resource intensive
- Blockchain for business generally prioritize:
  - assets over crypto
  - identity over anonymity
  - selective endorsement over proof of work
