#### INTRODUCING_AI

---

##### 01

At IBM, we define AI as
anything that makes machines act more intelligently
We like to think of AI as
augmented intelligence.
We believe that AI should not attempt
to replace human experts, but rather extend human capabilities
and accomplish tasks that neither humans
nor machines could do on their own.
The internet has given us access to more information, faster.
Distributed computing and IoT have led to massive amounts of data,
and social networking has encouraged most of that data to be unstructured.
With Augmented Intelligence, we are putting information
that subject matter experts need at their fingertips,
and backing it with evidence so they can make informed decisions.
We want experts to scale their capabilities and let the machines do the time-consuming work.
How do we define intelligence?
Human beings have innate intelligence, defined as the intelligence that governs every activity in our body.
This intelligence is what causes an oak tree to grow out of a little seed, and an elephant to form from a single-celled organism.
How does AI learn? The only innate intelligence machines have is what we give them.
We provide machines the ability to examine examples and create machine learning models based on the inputs and desired outputs.
And we do this in different ways such as Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning,
and Reinforcement Learning, about which you will learn in more detail in subsequent lessons.
Based on strength, breadth, and application, AI can be described in different ways.
Weak or Narrow AI is AI that is applied to a specific domain. For example, language translators, virtual assistants,
self-driving cars, AI-powered web searches, recommendation engines, and intelligent spam filters.
Applied AI can perform specific tasks, but not learn new ones, making decisions based on programmed algorithms, and training data.
Strong AI or Generalized AI is AI that can interact and operate a wide variety of independent and unrelated tasks.
It can learn new tasks to solve new problems, and it does this by teaching itself new strategies.
Generalized Intelligence is the combination of many AI strategies that learn from experience and can perform at a human level of intelligence.
Super AI or Conscious AI is AI with human-level consciousness, which would require it to be self-aware.
Because we are not yet able to adequately define what consciousness is, it is unlikely that we will be able to create a conscious AI in the near future.
AI is the fusion of many fields of study. Computer science and electrical engineering determine how AI is implemented in software and hardware.
Mathematics and statistics determine viable models and measure performance.
Because AI is modeled on how we believe the brain works, psychology and linguistics play an essential role in understanding how AI might work.
And philosophy provides guidance on intelligence and ethical considerations.
While the science fiction version of AI may be a distant possibility,
we already see more and more AI involved in the decisions we make every day.
Over the years, AI has proven to be useful in different domains, impacting the lives of people and our society in meaningful ways.

There's a lot of talk about artificial intelligence
these days. How do you define or what does AI mean for you? There is a lot of talk and
there's a lot of definitions for what artificial intelligence says. So one of them is about
teaching the machines to learn, and act, and think as humans would. Another dimension is
really about how do we get the machines to- how do we impart more of a cognitive capabilities
on the machines and sensory capabilities. So
it's about analyzing images and videos about natural language processing and understanding
speech. It's about pattern recognition, and so on, and so forth. So the third axis
is more around creating a technology that's able to,
in some cases, replace what humans do. I'd like to think of this as augment what humans
do. To me personally, the most important part of definition for artificial intelligence
is about imparting the ability to think and learn on the machines. To me that's what defines
artificial intelligence. AI is the application of computing to solve
problems in an intelligent way using algorithms. So what is an intelligent way? Well, an intelligent
way may be something that mimics human intelligence. Or it may be a purely computational approach
and optimization approach but something that manipulates data in a way to
get not obvious results out, I think, is what I would classify
as being artificially intelligent. I would define AI as a tool that uses computer to
complete a task automatically with very little to no human intervention.
To me AI is really a complex series of layers of algorithms that
do something with the information that's coming into it.
Artificial intelligence is a set of technologies that
allows us to extract knowledge from data. So it's any kind of system that learns or
understands patterns within that data, and can identify them, and then reproduce them
on new information. Artificial intelligence is not the kind of
simulating human intelligence that people think it is.
It's really not about intelligence at all. But I think another word that describes AI
more accurately today is machine learning. The reason I say that is because machine learning
technology is all about using essentially mathematics on computers in order to find
patterns in data. Now this data can be structured or unstructured.
The only difference between machine learning and
the technologies that came before it is instead of us, as humans, having to manually hard
code these patterns, and these conditions into computers. They're
able to find these patterns on their own by using math. That's really the only difference
here. So what I'd say artificial intelligence is, is it's a set of mathematical algorithms
that enable us to have computers find, very deep and patterns that we may not have even
known exist, without us having to hard code them manually.

Define Generative AI and describe its significance, and
Explain different use cases of Generative AI.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is defined as Augmented Intelligence that enables experts
to scale their capabilities while machines handle time-consuming tasks like recognizing
speech, playing games, and making decisions.
On the other hand, Generative Artificial Intelligence, or GenAI, is an AI technique capable of creating
new and unique data, ranging from images and music to text and entire virtual worlds.
Unlike conventional AI models that rely on pre-defined rules and patterns, Generative
AI models use deep learning techniques and rely on vast datasets to generate entirely
new data with various applications.
A Generative AI model can also use LLM, Large Language Model, a type of artificial intelligence
based on deep learning techniques designed to process and generate natural language.
For instance, Generative AI can develop new and more powerful LLM algorithms or architectures,
resulting in more accurate or efficient natural language processing and generation capabilities.
Alternatively, a Generative AI can design and incorporate LLM into a larger, more advanced
AI system to perform various advanced tasks, such as decision-making, problem-solving,
and creative work.
Generative AI encompasses various AI technologies and the idea of developing AI systems.
Although more about Generative AI will soon unfold, the following benefits already make
Generative AI a strategic technology:
Creativity and innovation,
Cost and time savings,
Personalization,
Scalability,
Robustness, and
Exploration of new possibilities.
Let us look at some diverse use cases of Generative AI.

genetic mutations responsible for patients' illnesses and providing tailored treatments.
It can also produce medical images, simulate surgeries, and predict new drug properties
to aid doctors in practicing procedures and developing treatments.
In agriculture, Generative AI can optimize crop yields and create more robust plant varieties
that can withstand environmental stressors, pests, and diseases.
In biotechnology, Generative AI can aid in the development of new therapies and drugs
by identifying potential drug targets, simulating drug interactions, and forecasting drug efficacy.
In forensics, Generative AI can help solve crimes by analyzing DNA evidence and identifying
suspects.
In environmental conservation, Generative AI can support the protection of endangered
species by analyzing their genetic data and suggesting breeding and conservation strategies.
In creative fields, Generative AI can produce unique digital art, music, and video content
for advertising and marketing campaigns, and generate soundtracks for films or video games.

AI is here to stay, with the promise of transforming the way the world works.
According to a study by PWC, $16 trillion of GDP will
be added between now and 2030 on the basis of AI.
This is a never before seen scale of economic impact, and it is not just
in the IT industry, it impacts virtually every industry and aspect of our lives.
AI means different things to different people.
For a videogame designer, AI means writing the code that affects how bots play,
and how the environment reacts to the player.
For a screenwriter, AI means a character that acts like a human,
with some trope of computer features mixed in.
For a data scientist, AI is a way of exploring and
classifying data to meet specific goals.
AI algorithms that learn by example are the reason we can talk to Watson,
Alexa, Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant, and they can talk back to us.
The natural language processing and
natural language generation capabilities of AI are not only enabling machines and
humans to understand and interact with each other, but
are creating new opportunities and new ways of doing business.
Chatbots powered by natural language processing capabilities, are being used in
healthcare to question patients and run basic diagnoses like real doctors.
In education, they are providing students with
easy to learn conversational interfaces and on-demand online tutors.
Customer service chatbots are improving customer experience by resolving
queries on the spot and freeing up agents time for conversations that add value.
AI-powered advances in speech-to-text technology have made real time
transcription a reality.
Advances in speech synthesis are the reason companies are using AI-powered
voice to enhance customer experience, and give their brand its unique voice.
In the field of medicine, it's helping patients with Lou Gehrig's disease,
for example, to regain their real voice in place of using a computerized voice.
It is due to advances in AI that the field of computer vision has been able to
surpass humans in tasks related to detecting and labeling objects.
Computer vision is one of the reasons why cars can steer their way on streets and
highways and avoid hitting obstacles.
Computer vision algorithms detect facial features and images and
compare them with databases of face profiles.
This is what allows consumer devices to authenticate the identities of their
owners through facial recognition, social media apps to detect and tag users, and
law enforcement agencies to identify criminals in video feeds.
Computer vision algorithms are helping automate tasks.
Such as detecting cancerous moles in skin images or
finding symptoms in x-ray and MRI scan.
AI is impacting the quality of our lives on a daily basis.
There's AI in our Netflix queue, our navigation apps,
keeping spam out of our inboxes and reminding us of important events.
AI is working behind the scenes
monitoring our investments, detecting fraudulent transactions,
identifying credit card fraud, and preventing financial crimes.
AI is impacting healthcare in significant ways,
by helping doctors arrive at more accurate preliminary diagnoses,
reading medical imaging, finding appropriate clinical trials for patients.
It is not just influencing patient outcomes But
also making operational processes less expensive.
AI has the potential to access enormous amounts of information, imitate humans,
even specific humans, make life-changing recommendations about health and
finances, correlate data that may invade privacy, and much more.
