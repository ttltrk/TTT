#### IMAGES

HTML images are defined with the ```<img>``` tag.

#### ELEMENTS

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.



```html
<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
```

HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
The ```<br>``` tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag

```html
<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>
```
