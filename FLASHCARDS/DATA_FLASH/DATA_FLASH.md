#### DATA_DICTIONARY

A Data Dictionary is a collection of names, definitions, and attributes about data elements that are being used or captured in a database, information system, or part of a research project.

A data dictionary is a centralized repository of metadata.

#### METADATA

Metadata is data about data.

#### DATA_MART

A data mart is a simple form of data warehouse focused on a single subject or line of business. With a data mart, teams can access data and gain insights faster, because they don't have to spend time searching within a more complex data warehouse or manually aggregating data from different sources.

Datamarts are a fully managed database that enables you to store and explore your data in a relational and fully managed Azure SQL DB. Datamarts provide SQL support, a no-code visual query designer, Row Level Security (RLS), and auto-generation of a semantic model for each datamart.

For example, a marketing team may use data marts to analyze consumer behaviors, while sales staff could use data marts to compile quarterly sales reports.
