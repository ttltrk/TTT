#### WHAT_IS_BOOTSTRAP

- Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development
- Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins

Responsive web design is about creating web sites which automatically adjust themselves to look good on all devices, from small phones to large desktops.

#### CONTAINERS

Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents.

Containers are used to pad the content inside of them, and there are two container classes available:

- The ```.container class``` provides a responsive fixed width container
- The ```.container-fluid``` class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport
