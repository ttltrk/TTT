#### CLOUD_COMPUTING

The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer

On-Premise:

- You own the servers
- You hire the IT people
- You pay or rent the real-estate
- You take all the risk

Cloud Providers:

- Someone else owns the servers
- Someone else hires the IT people
- Someone else pays for your config cloud services and code, someone else takes care of the rest

#### SIX_ADVANTAGES_OF_CLOUD

- 1 - Trade capital expense for variable expense
  - No upfront-cost instead of paying for data centers and servers. Pay on-demand pay only when you consume computing resources

- 2 - Benefit from massive economic of scale
  - Usage from hundreds of thousands of customers aggregated in the cloud. You are sharing the cost with other customers to get unbeatable savings

- 3 - Stop guessing capacity
  - Eliminate guesswork about infrastructure capacity needs. Instead of paying for idle or underutilized servers, you can scale up or down to meet the current need.

- 4 - Increase speed and agility
  - Launch resources within a few clicks in minutes instead of waiting days or weeks of your IT to implement the solution on-premise

- 5 - Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
  - Focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking and powering servers

- 6 - Go global in minutes
  - Deploy your app in multiple regions around the world with a few clicks. Provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost
