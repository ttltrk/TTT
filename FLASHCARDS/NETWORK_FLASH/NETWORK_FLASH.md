#### OSI_REFERENCE_MODEL

OSI = Open System Interconnection  

OSI reference model

```
Layer 7 - Application
Layer 6 - Presentation
Layer 5 - Session
Layer 4 - Transport
Layer 3 - Network
Layer 2 - Data Link
Layer 1 - Physical  
```

#### ANALOG_MODEM

Layer 1 device

modem = modulator/demodulator

modems were developed to take the digital signal coming from a digital node and
convert it to an analog signal (modulating the signal) to be placed on the wire.

#### HUB

Layer 1 device

a hub functions as a concentrator/repeater in that it doesn't care where the signal comes from or where it is going
it takes the electrical signal that arrives on a port and replicates that signal out all of the other ports

#### SWITCH

Layer 2 device

A switch will only communicates with the local network devices

- using switch for connect pcs
- cat5, cat6 cable
- optic cable is much faster then copper cable
- we always use cables to connect comps to the switch
- a switch cannot use wireless technology
- if you want the devices in the same env to be connect to each other over wireless technology, you should use an Access Point

```
Access Points >> wireless
Switches >> Cables
```

#### WAP

Layer 2 device

WAP = Wireless Access point

A WAP is a specific type of network bridge that connects (bridges) wireless network segments with wired network segments.  
the most common type WAP bridges 802.11 wireless network segments with 802.3 Ethernet network segments
A WAP will only communicates with local network devices

```
Access Points >> wireless
Switches >> Cables
```
