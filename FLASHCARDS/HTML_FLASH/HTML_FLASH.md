<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>

#### DOCTYPE

The ```<!DOCTYPE>``` declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
The ```<!DOCTYPE>``` declaration is not case sensitive.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

#### LINKS

HTML links are defined with the ```<a>``` tag

```html
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.

```html
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
```

examples:

```html
<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>
```

#### ATTRIBUTES

HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

- All HTML elements can have attributes
- The href attribute of ```<a>``` specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
- The src attribute of ```<img>``` specifies the path to the image to be displayed
- The width and height attributes of ```<img>``` provide size information for images
- The alt attribute of ```<img>``` provides an alternate text for an image
- The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
- The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
- The title attribute defines some extra information about an element

```html
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>
```

```html
<img src="img_girl.jpg">
```

```html
<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">
```

```html
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
```

```html
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
```

```html
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
```

#### HEADINGS

HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.
HTML headings are defined with the ```<h1>``` to ```<h6>``` tags.
The ```<h1>``` defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```

---

#### PARAGRAPHS

A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.
The HTML ```<p>``` element defines a paragraph.
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>
```

With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.

---

#### HORIZONTAL_RULES

The ```<hr>``` tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
The ```<hr>``` element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.

```html
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>
```

The <hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.

---

#### LINE_BREAKS

The HTML ```<br>``` element defines a line break.
Use ```<br>``` if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph.

```html
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>
```

The ```<br>``` tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
