#### DRIVEN_BY_MONEY

- Ransomware files and systems are encrypted with attackers keys and they demand you to pay money to get your data back.
- Cryptocurrency miners; your systems are infected with a low-profile cryptocurrency mining tool. This tool uses the CPU to try make money on a cryptocurrency for the attackers.
- BEC ("Business Email Compromise"). Users get hacked through all sorts of methods and their emails are compromised. Via email compromise the attackers can intercept communications, for example an invoice, and try to redirect payments to other banks and accounts.
