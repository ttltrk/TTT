#### CLOUD_COMPUTING

The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store,
manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer

On-Premise:
- You own the servers
- You hire the IT people
- You pay or rent the real-estate
- You take all the risk

Cloud Providers:
- Someone else owns the servers
- Someone else hires the IT people
- Someone else pays for your config cloud services and code, someone else
takes care of the rest

Six advantages and benefits of cloud computing

- Trade capital expense for variable expense
  - No upfront-cost instead of paying for data centers and servers. Pay on-demand
    pay only when you consume computing resources
- Benefit from massive economic of scale
  - Usage from hundreds of thousands of customers aggregated in the cloud. You are sharing
    the cost with other customers to get unbeatable savings
- Stop guessing capacity
  - Eliminate guesswork about infrastructure capacity needs. Instead of paying for idle
    or underutilized servers, you can scale up or down to meet the current need.
- Increase speed and agility
  - Launch resources within a few clicks in minutes instead of waiting days or weeks of your IT
    to implement the solution on-premise
- Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
  - Focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking and powering servers
- Go global in minutes   
  - Deploy your app in multiple regions around the world with a few clicks. Provide lower latency and a better
    experience for your customers at minimal cost

#### INTRO_AND_MAP_OVERVIEW

- 69 availability zones within 22 geographic regions around the world

- regions: physical location in the world with multiple availability zones
- availability zones: one or more discrete data centers
- edge location: datacenter owned by a trusted AWS

#### REGIONS

A geographical distinct location which has multiple datacenters (AZs)
Every region is physically isolated from and independent of every other region in terms of location, power, water supply
Each regions has at least 2 AZs
AWS largest region is US-EAST
New services almost always become available first in US-EAST
Not all services are available in all regions
US-EAST-1 is the region where you see all your billing info
