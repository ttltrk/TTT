#### CLOUD_COMPUTING

The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store,
manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer

On-Premise:
- You own the servers
- You hire the IT people
- You pay or rent the real-estate
- You take all the risk

Cloud Providers:
- Someone else owns the servers
- Someone else hires the IT people
- Someone else pays for your config cloud services and code, someone else
takes care of the rest

Six advantages and benefits of cloud computing

- Trade capital expense for variable expense
  - No upfront-cost instead of paying for data centers and servers. Pay on-demand
    pay only when you consume computing resources
- Benefit from massive economic of scale
  - Usage from hundreds of thousands of customers aggregated in the cloud. You are sharing
    the cost with other customers to get unbeatable savings
- Stop guessing capacity
  - Eliminate guesswork about infrastructure capacity needs. Instead of paying for idle
    or underutilized servers, you can scale up or down to meet the current need.
- Increase speed and agility
  - Launch resources within a few clicks in minutes instead of waiting days or weeks of your IT
    to implement the solution on-premise
- Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
  - Focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking and powering servers
- Go global in minutes   
  - Deploy your app in multiple regions around the world with a few clicks. Provide lower latency and a better
    experience for your customers at minimal cost

#### EVOLUTION_OF_CLOUD_HOSTING

- Dedicated server: One physical machine dedicated to single a business. runs a single
  web-app/site. Very expensive, high maintenance.

- Virtual Private server (VPS): One physical machine dedicated to a single business. The physical
  machine is virtualized into sub-machines. Runs multiple web-apps/sites. Better Utilization and
  isolation of resources.

- Shared hosting: One physical machine, shared by hundred of business. Relies on most tenants
  under-utilizing their resources. Very cheap, Limited functionality, poor isolation.

- Cloud hosting: Multiple physical machines that act as one system. The system is abstracted
  into multiple cloud services. Flexible, scalable, secure, cost-effective, high-configurability.

#### WHAT_IS_AMAZON

An American multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in Seattle, Washington.
Amazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos and the company started as an online store for books and expanded to
other products.

Amazon has expanded beyond just an online e-commerce store into:
  - cloud computing (AWS)
  - digital streaming (Amazon prime Video, Amazon Prime Music, Twitch.tv)
  - Grocery Stores (Whole Foods Market)
  - artificial intelligence
  - Low orbit satellites (Kuniper Systems)
  - more...

Andy Jassy is the current CEO of Amazon.

#### WHAT_IS_AWS

Amazon calls their cloud provider service Amazon Web Services - commonly referred to just AWS.
AWS was launched in 2006 is the leading cloud service provider in the world. Cloud Service Providers
can be initialized as CSPs.

- SQS - Simple Queue Service - was the first AWS service launched for public use in 2004
- S3 - Simple Storage Service - was launched in 2006
- EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud - was launched in 2006

In November 2010, it was reported that all of Amazon.com's retail sites had migrated to AWS.
To support industry-wide training and skills standardization, AWS began offering
a certification program for computer engineers, on April 2013.

#### WHAT_IS_A_CSP

A Cloud Service Provider is a company which:

- provides multiple Cloud Services e.g. tens to hundreds of services
- those Cloud Services can be chained together to create cloud architectures
- those Cloud Services are accessible via Single Unified API e.g. AWS API
- those Cloud Services utilized metered billing based on usage e.g. per second, per hour  
- those Cloud Services have rich monitoring built in e.g. AWS CloudTrail
- those Cloud Services have an Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS) offering
- those Cloud Services offers automation via Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Domain name >> Load Balancer >> Web Server >> Postgres DB / Sends Emails / Analytics / Stores Images

If a company offers multiple cloud services under a single UI but do not meet most of or all of these
requirements, it would be referred to as a Cloud Platform e.g. Twilio, HashiCorp, Databricks

#### TYPES_OF_CC

- SAAS for customers - Software as a Service, A completed product that is run and managed by the service providers
- PAAS for developers - Platform as a Service, Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying
                        infrastructure. Focus on the deployment and management of your applications.
- IAAS for admins - Infrastructures as a Service, The basic building blocks for cloud IT. Provides access to networking
                    feature, computers and data storage space

#### CLOUD_COMPUTING_DEPLOYMENT_MODELS

```
- Cloud
  - Fully utilizing cloud computing
    - startups
    - SaaS offerings
    - New projects and companies

- Hybrid
  - Using both Cloud and On-Premise
    - Banks
    - FinTech, Investment management
    - Large Professional Service providers
    - Legacy on-premise

- On-Premise
  - Deploying resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools, is sometimes called "private cloud"
    - Public sector
    - Super sensitive data - hospitals
    -  large enterprise with heavy regulation - insure companies

#### INTRO_AND_MAP_OVERVIEW

- 69 availability zones within 22 geographic regions around the world

- regions: physical location in the world with multiple availability zones
- availability zones: one or more discrete data centers
- edge location: datacenter owned by a trusted AWS

[^^^](#AWS_CCP)

---

#### REGIONS

A geographical distinct location which has multiple datacenters (AZs)
Every region is physically isolated from and independent of every other region in terms of location, power, water supply
Each regions has at least 2 AZs
AWS largest region is US-EAST
New services almost always become available first in US-EAST
Not all services are available in all regions
US-EAST-1 is the region where you see all your billing info  

[^^^](#AWS_CCP)

---

#### AVAILABILITY_ZONES

```
An AZ is a datacenter owned and operated by AWS in which AWS service run
Each region has at least two AZs
AZs are represented by a Region Code, followed by a letter identifier eg. us-east-1a
Multi-AZ  Distributing your instances across multiple AZs allows failover configuration for handling
requests when one goes down.
<10ms latency between AZs
```

[^^^](#AWS_CCP)

---

#### EDGE_LOCATIONS

An edge location is a datacenter owned by a trusted partner of AWS which has a direct connection to the AWS network.
These locations server requests for CloudFront and Route 53. Requests going to either of these services will be routed
to the nearest edge location automatically.
S3 Transfer Acceleration traffic and API Gateway endpoint traffic also use the AWS edge network .
This allows for low latency no matter where the end user is geographically located.

#### GOVCLOUD_REGIONS

AWS GovCloud regions allow customers to host sensitive Controlled Unclassified Information and other types of regulated
workloads.
GovCloud regions are only operated by employees who are US citizens on US soil.
They are only accessible to US entities and root account holders who pass a screening process.
Customers can architect secure cloud solutions that comply with:
- FedRAMP high baseline
- DOJs Criminal Justice Information Systems (CJIS) Security policy
- US international traffic in ARMS regulations (ITAR)
- Export administration regulations (EAR)
- Department of Defense (DOD) Cloud computing security requirements guide
