#### CLOUD_COMPUTING

The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store,
manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer

On-Premise:
- You own the servers
- You hire the IT people
- You pay or rent the real-estate
- You take all the risk

Cloud Providers:
- Someone else owns the servers
- Someone else hires the IT people
- Someone else pays for your config cloud services and code, someone else
takes care of the rest

Six advantages and benefits of cloud computing

- Trade capital expense for variable expense
  - No upfront-cost instead of paying for data centers and servers. Pay on-demand
    pay only when you consume computing resources
- Benefit from massive economic of scale
  - Usage from hundreds of thousands of customers aggregated in the cloud. You are sharing
    the cost with other customers to get unbeatable savings
- Stop guessing capacity
  - Eliminate guesswork about infrastructure capacity needs. Instead of paying for idle
    or underutilized servers, you can scale up or down to meet the current need.
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers
- Go global in minutes
