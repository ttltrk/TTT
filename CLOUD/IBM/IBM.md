#### INTRO

Welcome to introduction to cloud computing, the first in the series of
four courses designed to give you the foundational skills you need to be a
cloud practitioner. Today cloud represents a huge market, one that is
continuing to grow at an unprecedented scale. Enormous computational power, once
considered a prerogative of large enterprises, is now available at the
fingertips of even the smallest of businesses and individual developers,
thanks to Cloud.

Moreover, the Cloud makes all this computational power highly affordable
with pay-as-you-go economics. If you look at some of the key emerging technologies
of our times, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things,
Blockchain and Analytics, all of these technologies work with massive amounts
of data and need huge storage space and computational power in order to work -
making cloud possibly the only viable platform for these technologies.

This course will introduce you to the core concepts of cloud computing - from its
essential characteristics to the different service and deployment models,
cloud architecture, security and monitoring, emerging technologies
supported by the cloud, and career opportunities available in the domain.

The course is designed for everyone - it doesn't matter if you have a background
in cloud technologies. Whether you're an IT person looking to upscale or explore
this domain, a fresh graduate looking to make a career in cloud technologies, or
an IT decision-maker, this course will equip you with what you need to get
started. With just the public cloud service market expected to grow to 331.2
billion by 2022, it's a time to be in the cloud computing
industry. Today there are more open positions in cloud than the number of
skilled people available. And the sheer growth of the cloud market makes it an
exciting and dependable career prospect for the coming times. So, congratulations
on embarking on this exciting journey. And good luck!

##### Definition and Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing, also referred to as “the cloud,” is the delivery of on-demand computing
resources—everything from applications to data centers—over the internet on a pay-for-use
basis.

To get a common understanding of cloud computing, let’s start with the US National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST’s) definition of cloud computing.

NIST defines cloud computing as a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access
to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned
and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Examples of computing resources include:
- networks
- servers
- storage
- applications
- services

This cloud model is composed of:
- five essential characteristics
- three deployment models
- three service models

5 Essential characteristics of the cloud:

- on-demand self-service
- broad network access
- resource pooling
- rapid elasticity
- measured service

1. On-demand Self-service: the 1st characteristic, means that you get access to cloud resources
such as the processing power, storage, and network you need, using a simple interface,
without requiring human interaction with each service provider.

2. Broad Network Access, means that cloud computing resources can be
accessed via the network through standard mechanisms and platforms such as mobile phones,
tablets, laptops, and workstations.

3. Resource Pooling, is what gives cloud providers economies of
scale, which they pass on to their customers, making cloud cost-efficient.
Using a multi-tenant model, computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers; cloud
resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned, according to demand, without customers needing
to concern themselves with the physical location of these resources.

4. Rapid Elasticity, the 4th characteristic, implies that you can access more resources
when you need them, and scale back when you don’t—because resources are elastically
provisioned and released.

5. Measured Service, means that you only pay for what you use or
reserve as you go; if you’re not using resources, you’re not paying.
Resource usage is monitored, measured, and reported transparently based on utilization.

As we see, cloud computing is really about utilizing technology “as a service”—leveraging
remote systems on-demand over the open internet, scaling up and scaling back, and paying for
what you use.
It is a revolution in that it has changed the way the world consumes compute services
by making them more cost-efficient while also making organizations more agile in responding
to changes in their markets.

As I mentioned earlier in this talk, the cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics,
three deployment models, and three service models.
We just went over the five essential characteristics.
While we will go into greater depth of the deployment and the service models in the later
videos, let me leave you with a brief overview of these models.

There are three types of cloud deployment models:

- Public
- Private
- Hybrid

1. Public cloud is when you leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by
the cloud provider, but its usage is shared by other companies.

2. Private cloud means that the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single
organization. It could run on-premises or it could be owned, managed, and operated by a service provider.

3. And when you use a mix of both public and private clouds, working together seamlessly,
that is classified as the Hybrid model.

Now, let’s look at the three service models that are based on the three layers in a computing stack:

- Infrastructure
- Platform
- Applications

These cloud computing models are aptly referred to as:

- Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

1. In an Infrastructure as a Service model, you get access to infrastructure and physical
computing resources such as servers, networking, storage, and data center space - without the
need to manage or operate them.

2. In a Platform as a Service model, you get access to the platform, that is the hardware
and software tools, usually those needed to develop and deploy applications to users over
the Internet.

3. Software as a Service is a software licensing and delivery model in which software and applications
are centrally hosted and licensed on a subscription basis, and sometimes also referred to as "on-demand
software."
