#### MODULE_1_OVERVIEW_CLOUD_COMPUTING

##### Definition and Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing, also referred to as “the cloud,” is the delivery of on-demand computing
resources—everything from applications to data centers—over the internet on a pay-for-use
basis.

To get a common understanding of cloud computing, let’s start with the US National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST’s) definition of cloud computing.

NIST defines cloud computing as a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access
to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned
and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

Examples of computing resources include:
- networks
- servers
- storage
- applications
- services

This cloud model is composed of:
- five essential characteristics
- three deployment models
- three service models

5 Essential characteristics of the cloud:

- on-demand self-service
- broad network access
- resource pooling
- rapid elasticity
- measured service

1. On-demand Self-service: the 1st characteristic, means that you get access to cloud resources
such as the processing power, storage, and network you need, using a simple interface,
without requiring human interaction with each service provider.

2. Broad Network Access, means that cloud computing resources can be
accessed via the network through standard mechanisms and platforms such as mobile phones,
tablets, laptops, and workstations.

3. Resource Pooling, is what gives cloud providers economies of
scale, which they pass on to their customers, making cloud cost-efficient.
Using a multi-tenant model, computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers; cloud
resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned, according to demand, without customers needing
to concern themselves with the physical location of these resources.

4. Rapid Elasticity, the 4th characteristic, implies that you can access more resources
when you need them, and scale back when you don’t—because resources are elastically
provisioned and released.

5. Measured Service, means that you only pay for what you use or
reserve as you go; if you’re not using resources, you’re not paying.
Resource usage is monitored, measured, and reported transparently based on utilization.

As we see, cloud computing is really about utilizing technology “as a service”—leveraging
remote systems on-demand over the open internet, scaling up and scaling back, and paying for
what you use.
It is a revolution in that it has changed the way the world consumes compute services
by making them more cost-efficient while also making organizations more agile in responding
to changes in their markets.
+
As I mentioned earlier in this talk, the cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics,
three deployment models, and three service models.
We just went over the five essential characteristics.
While we will go into greater depth of the deployment and the service models in the later
videos, let me leave you with a brief overview of these models.

There are three types of cloud deployment models:

- Public
- Private
- Hybrid

1. Public cloud is when you leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by
the cloud provider, but its usage is shared by other companies.

2. Private cloud means that the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single
organization. It could run on-premises or it could be owned, managed, and operated by a service provider.

3. And when you use a mix of both public and private clouds, working together seamlessly,
that is classified as the Hybrid model.

Now, let’s look at the three service models that are based on the three layers in a computing stack:

- Infrastructure
- Platform
- Applications

These cloud computing models are aptly referred to as:

- Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

1. In an Infrastructure as a Service model, you get access to infrastructure and physical
computing resources such as servers, networking, storage, and data center space - without the
need to manage or operate them.

2. In a Platform as a Service model, you get access to the platform, that is the hardware
and software tools, usually those needed to develop and deploy applications to users over
the Internet.

3. Software as a Service is a software licensing and delivery model in which software and applications
are centrally hosted and licensed on a subscription basis, and sometimes also referred to as "on-demand
software."

##### History and Evolution of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is an evolution of technology over time.

The concept of cloud computing dates to the 1950s when large-scale mainframes with high-volume
processing power became available.
In order to make efficient use of the computing power of mainframes, the practice of time
sharing, or resource pooling, evolved.
Using dumb terminals, whose sole purpose was to facilitate access to the mainframes, multiple
users were able to access the same data storage layer and CPU power from any terminal.

In the 1970s, with the release of an operating system called Virtual Machine (VM), it became
possible for mainframes to have multiple virtual systems, or virtual machines, on a single
physical node.
The virtual machine operating system evolved the 1950s application of shared access of
a mainframe by allowing multiple distinct compute environments to exist on the same
physical hardware.
Each virtual machine hosted guest operating systems that behaved as though they had their
own memory, CPU, and hard drives, even though these were shared resources.
Virtualization thus became a technology driver and a huge catalyst for some of the biggest
evolutions in communications and computing.

Even 20 years ago, physical hardware was quite expensive.
With the internet becoming more accessible, and the need to make hardware costs more viable,
servers were virtualized into shared hosting environments, virtual private servers, and
virtual dedicated servers, using the same types of functionality provided by the virtual
machine operating system.

So, for example, if a company needed ‘x’ number of physical systems to run their applications,
they could take one physical node and split it into multiple virtual systems.
This was enabled by hypervisors.

A hypervisor is a small software layer that enables multiple operating systems to run
alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources.
A hypervisor also separates the Virtual Machines logically, assigning each its own slice of
the underlying computing power, memory, and storage, preventing the virtual machines from
interfering with each other.
So, if, for example, one operating system suffers a crash or a security compromise,
the others keep working.
As technologies and hypervisors improved and were able to share and deliver resources reliably,
some companies decided to make the cloud’s benefits accessible to users who didn’t
have an abundance of physical servers to create their own cloud computing infrastructure.
Since the servers were already online, the process of spinning up a new instance was
instantaneous.
Users could now order cloud resources they needed from a larger pool of available resources,
and they could pay for them on a per-use basis, also known as Pay-As-You-Go.

This pay-as-you-go or utility computing model became one of the key drivers behind cloud
computing taking off.
The pay-per-use model allowed companies and even individual developers to pay for the
computing resources as and when they used them, just like units of electricity.
This allowed them to switch to a more cash-flow friendly OpEx model from a CapEx model.
This model appealed to all sizes of companies, those who had little or no hardware, and even
those that had lots of hardware, because now, instead of making huge capital expenditures
in hardware, they could pay for compute resources as and when needed.
It also allowed them to scale their workloads during usage peaks, and scale down when usage
subsided.

And this gave rise to modern-day cloud computing.
The impact of the evolution of the cloud has been immense.
In the next training, we will go over some key considerations for cloud adoption.

##### Key Considerations for Cloud Computing

Every organization’s transformation journey is unique, and therefore every organization’s
cloud adoption strategy is also unique to them.

Agility, flexibility, and competitiveness are key drivers for moving to the cloud, provided
it is done without creating business disruption or issues related to security, compliance,
and performance.
Let’s look at some key considerations that organizations can use as a guide while working
through their cloud strategy.

1. The first consideration is infrastructure and workloads.

The cost of building and operating data centers can become astronomical.
On the other hand, low initial costs and pay-as-you-go attributes of cloud computing can add up to
significant cost savings.
Also, a point to consider is that not all workloads may be ready for the cloud, as-is.

2. The second consideration is around SaaS and development platforms.

Organizations need to consider if paying for application access is a more viable option
than purchasing off-the-shelf software and subsequently investing in upgrades.
Organizations also need to consider speed and productivity—what it means for them
to get a new application up and running in ‘x’ hours on the cloud versus a couple
of weeks, even months on traditional platforms.
And the person-hour cost efficiencies they gain from using cloud dashboards, real-time
statistics, and active analytics.

Lastly, organizations need to consider the impact of making a wrong decision—their
risk exposure.
Is it riskier, for example, for them to invest in the hardware and software or rent by the
hour?

Is it safer for them to work on a 12-month plan to build, write, test, and release the
code if they’re uncertain about adoption?
And is it better for them to “try” something new paying-as-you-go rather than making long-term
decisions based on little or no trial or adoption?
Let’s look at some of the benefits of cloud adoption, categorized broadly into Flexibility,
Efficiency, and Strategic Value.

Cloud gives us flexibility.

Users can scale back or scale up services to fit their needs, customize applications,
and access cloud services from anywhere with an internet connection.
Cloud infrastructure scales on demand to support fluctuating workloads.
Organizations can determine their level of control with as-a-service options.
Users can select from a menu of pre-built tools and features to build a solution that
fits their specific needs.
And Virtual Private Clouds, encryption, and API keys help keep data secure.

Cloud also brings great efficiency.

Enterprise users can get applications to market quickly without worrying about underlying
infrastructure costs or its maintenance.
Cloud-based applications and data are accessible from virtually any internet-connected device.
Hardware failures do not result in data loss because of networked backups.

Cloud computing uses remote resources, saving organizations the cost of servers and other
equipment, and paying on use-basis.

Cloud services give enterprises a competitive advantage by providing the most innovative
technologies available while managing the underlying infrastructure, thus enabling organizations
to focus on their priorities.

While cloud brings great opportunity, it also introduces challenges for business leaders
and IT departments.
Some of these perceived risks include: Data security, associated with loss or unavailability
of data causing business disruption; Governance and sovereignty issues;
Legal, regulatory, and compliance issues; Lack of standardization in how the constantly
evolving technologies integrate and interoperate; Choosing the right deployment and service
models to serve specific needs; Partnering with the right cloud service providers;
Concerns related to business continuity and disaster recovery.

Organizations can no longer think of cloud adoption as something that is to be looked
at in the future.
With the right cloud adoption strategies, technologies, services, and service providers,
these risks can be mitigated.
In the next training, we’re going to look at some of the key cloud service providers
of our times, and the services they offer.

##### Key Cloud Service Providers and Their Services

Let’s look at some numbers and predictions that help us see the scale cloud is predicted
to achieve in the coming years.
Gartner predicts: The worldwide public cloud service market
to grow from $182.4 B in 2018 to $331.2 B in 2022, attaining
a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.6%.

Spending on Infrastructure-as-a-Service to increase from $30.5 B in 2018
to $76.6 B in 2022, growing 27.5% in a year.

Platform-as-a-Service spending to grow from $15.6 B in 2018 to $31.8B
2022, growing 21.8% in a year.
With software investments shifting from cloud-first to cloud-only, spending on Sofware-as-a-Service
is expected to grow from $80 B in 2018 to $143.7 B in 2022.
What is clear is that cloud is accelerating faster than predicted, adoption is high, and
revenues are soaring.

The question for businesses today is no longer “if” they need to adopt the cloud, rather
“what” their cloud adoption strategy should be to best serve their businesses and customers.

Keeping up with this technological wave, and driving it forward, are the Cloud Service
Providers with a wide range of services.
We will now talk about some of the major Cloud Service Providers in alphabetical order.

##### No Longer a Choice

Cloud adoption is no longer a thing of the future.
From a single individual to a global multi-billion-dollar enterprise, anybody can access the computing
capacity they need on the cloud.
The lag time from decision to value is no longer a journey of years with high upfront
capital; cloud makes it possible for businesses to experiment, fail, and learn much faster
than ever before, with low risk exposure.

Businesses today have greater freedom to change course than to live with the consequences
of expensive decisions taken in the past.
According to an IBM Institute for Business Value study, more than three-quarters of enterprises
today are using cloud computing to expand into new industries.

74% have adopted cloud to improve customer experience; and 71% use cloud to create enhanced
products and services—while simultaneously downsizing legacy systems and reducing costs.
To remain competitive, businesses need to be able to respond quickly to marketplace
changes, use analytics to understand customer experience, and apply that understanding to
adapt their products and services based on what they learn.

Product lifecycles have shortened, and barriers to entry have become lower.
Today’s enablers for growth, agility, and innovation include:

Cognitively-enabled workflows, Applied exponential technologies such as AI, Automation, IoT, and Blockchain,
Applications that span new and legacy solutions; and dOpen hybrid and secure Multicloud infrastructures.

The power, scalability, flexibility, and pay-as-you-go economics of cloud provides the foundation
for this transformation.

The International Data Corporation, IDC, predicts that by 2025, the total amount of digital
data created worldwide will rise to 163 zettabytes (where one zettabyte is equivalent to a trillion
gigabytes).
And 30% of this data will be real-time information.

Considering the unprecedented amounts of data being produced daily, and the ability to make
data-driven decisions crucial to any business, cloud computing becomes essential for businesses
to succeed, sustain, and compete in today’s markets.
A cloud strategy, more than just an IT strategy, is the core component of any business strategy
today.

Businesses that haven’t already, or are not currently, integrating cloud into their
business strategy, run the risk of lacking the speed, agility, innovation, and decision-making
capacities needed to be competitive, as also their ability to respond to digital disruption.
In the next video, we’ll look at some case studies that demonstrate the impact businesses
have created by adopting cloud.

##### Some Case Studies

In this video, we will look at how some of the leading businesses have transformed the
way they work to provide better customer service, remove barriers to innovation, achieve enterprise
scale, and accelerate growth, using cloud technologies.
Although the case studies we’ll look at are curated from IBM Cloud, similar stories
with dramatic impact to business can be found across the spectrum of companies utilizing
other Cloud Service providers as well.

- BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE: In the highly competitive airline industry,
customer experience is a major point of differentiation, and digital channels are increasingly important.
To become more responsive to customer needs, American Airlines needed a new technology
platform and a new approach to development that would help it deliver digital self-service
tools and customer value more rapidly across its enterprise.
The airline recognized the opportunity to remove the constraints of their existing customer-facing
applications based on monolithic code into cloud-native based microservices architecture
on the cloud.

- The results: Faster development and release of new apps.
Improved operational reliability, productivity, and end customer response times.
Cost savings by avoiding existing upgrade costs via migration to the IBM Cloud.

- REMOVING BARRIERS TO INNOVATION: As a lean organization with a self-imposed
limit on headcount, UBank excels at finding innovative ways to meet demands.
Continually challenged to find more efficient ways to operate, UBank’s IT team explored
a Platform as a Service (PaaS) cloud development model.
Their need was to give more control to their developers, reduce the need for additional
resources, faster speed to market, and removing barriers in going from an idea to production.
UBank launched new initiatives in an IBM Cloud Platform environment, including a virtual
assistant that incorporates IBM Watson technology to support the bank’s online home loan application.

- The results: Faster time to market made possible through
the Cloud Platform framework that streamlines development and empowers product teams.
Foster greater innovation with cloud-based development resources that are quick, easy,
and cost-effective to deploy.

More efficient operations.

- DEMAND FOR ENTERPRISE SCALE: Since its inception in 2008, Bitly has journeyed
from a startup that offered intelligent link-shortening technology adopted by users to compress lengthy
URLs for social media posts, to an enterprise product.
Seeking an agile, cost-effective IT infrastructure to support this transition, Bitly started
planning for cloud migration.
Their need was to have a cloud-based model with pay-as-you-go pricing, the ability to
scale up and scale down, a more global presence, and the ability to geodistribute into more
POPs.
And they wanted it to be low-risk.
Bitly migrated to an IBM Cloud environment, establishing a scalable hosting platform for
low-latency delivery to enterprise customers around the world.
The results: 25 billion data-infused links migrated from
one hosting site to Cloud infrastructure with data center locations worldwide.
1 billion user interaction data set stored and managed in a flexible, cost-effective
Cloud Object Storage environment.
Transformed IT operations to scale for growth, control costs and focus valuable resources
on new product development.

- ACCELERATING GROWTH: Financial traders demand extreme speed and
availability from trading systems.
Profitability depends on split-second decisions.
As a leading online broker in forex, commodities, equities, cryptocurrencies, indices, and other
financial instruments, ActivTrades enables investors to buy and sell on numerous financial
markets.
Investors need reliable access to accurate market information, combined with the ability
to move rapidly to execute trades.
As its client base grew, ActivTrades wanted to cut latency, accelerate execution, and
streamline the delivery of new functions.
ActivTrades migrated three major trading systems from on-premises infrastructure to IBM Cloud
for VMware solutions, backed by data storage, networking, and security offerings on the IBM Cloud.

- The results: Up to 3X performance boost, helping clients
seize fleeting opportunities for profit.
Security-rich cloud platform with ultra-high availability protects client investments.
Hours, not days to fire up new resources, for faster response to emerging requirements.

##### Internet of Things in the Cloud

In this new era technologies such as Internet of Things, Big Data, artificial
intelligence, and blockchain are disrupting existing business models and
industries while creating unprecedented opportunities for businesses to
differentiate themselves and create value for their clients.

The power, scale, dynamic nature, and economics of the cloud resources make cloud computing a
key enabler for adoption and evolution of these emerging technologies.

The Internet of Things, or IoT, is a giant network of connected things and people that have changed much of how we
live our daily lives - from the way we drive, to how we make purchases,
monitoring our personal health, and even how we get energy for our homes. Smart
devices and sensors are continuously tracking and collecting data. For example,
a smart building could have thousands of sensors measuring all kinds of data
related to thermal, optical, structural, and environmental stimuli. An
unprecedented amount of data is being generated, putting a tremendous strain on
the Internet. That is where the cloud comes in, by
connecting the IoT device user to the cloud - be it for device registration,
device identity, storing data, or accessing enterprise data. Data collected
through IoT devices is stored and processed on the cloud since IoT devices
can be in a state of motion, the cloud serves as a collection point in closest
proximity, minimizing the latency in reporting up the data points and
providing a response back to the IoT application.
So, from IOT platforms running entirely on the cloud to the interfaces used by
customers to interact these devices, to the backend analytics
platforms - cloud computing supports and enables IoT.

Cloud service providers also offer specialized IoT services designed to help speed up the development of IoT
solutions. Let's look at a case study that demonstrates the use of the IoT on
the cloud to combat the poaching of endangered rhinos at Welgevonden by
making poaching predictable.

The rhinos have become one of the the key species that is becoming endangered due
to poaching throughout Africa. But now especially in South Africa.
Up until now, poachers have been increasing in numbers, and they become
more militarized with weapons. And so of course we've had to do the same. This is
not sustainable. The only way to do this better, is to bring in technology and
things that they do not have. This endangered species is getting help from
some unexpected friends, the zebra and antelope. They're wearing IoT sensors
connected to the IBM cloud. When poachers enter the area, the animals run for it,
which alerts Rangers who can track their emotions and help stop them before any
harm is done. It's a smart way to help increase the Rhino population and turn
the poachers into the endangered species.

##### Artificial Intelligence on the Cloud

Making sense of the endless streams of data is where Artificial Intelligence, or AI, comes
in.

Many of the applications where we apply AI today simply wouldn't have been possible without
the scalable, on-demand computing offered by the cloud.
There is a three-way relationship between AI, IoT, and Cloud.
Just as AI consumes the data produced by IoT devices, the IoT devices’ behavior can be
dictated based on responses from AI.

For example, Smart Assistants, a common type of IoT device, continues to learn about the
user’s preferences as usage grows, such as the songs they like, their home temperature
settings, preferred meal times, and over time they anticipate their actions based on the
user’s past history.

So, what we see is a symbiotic relationship between IoT, AI, and Cloud.

IoT delivers the data, AI powers the insights, and both these emerging technologies leverage
cloud’s scalability and processing power to provide value to individuals and businesses
alike.

Let’s look at how the United States Tennis Association, USTA, is using AI on the Cloud
to deliver unique digital experiences to millions of fans around the world.

For two weeks at the end of every summer, tennis fans around the world turn their eyes
to New York city, and the US Open.
Hundreds of thousands onsite, and millions more online.
But where you see tennis, IBM sees data;
the scores and statistics, the sights, the sounds.
IBM integrates and analyzes the data flowing from the court.
And delivers unique digital experiences to more than ten million tennis fans around the
world.
And we do it all in the IBM Cloud.
The IBM Cloud is the digital foundation of the US Open.
It scales rapidly to meet a five thousand percent increase in web traffic.
And it delivers a consistant experience to our fans all around the globe.
And with Watson on the IBM Cloud, we can engage fans in unique ways, year after year.
Slam Tracker analyzes more than twenty-six million historical data points.
It gives fans deep insight into featured matches, and it can see the momentum of a match shifting
in real time.
AI Highlights uses Watson to process thousands of hours of US Open video.
It can hear the cheers of the crowd.
It can see a player celebrating.
And it knows what makes a great tennis highlight.
And this year we're putting the power of AI Highlights into the hands of US players and
coaches.
Watson is analyzing match video,
so coaches can quickly find the footage they need to guide the development of their players.
And if you need to know where to park, find a good burger, or grab the latest US Open
gear, you can find the answers with the Guest Information feature in the US Open app
and mobile web, using Watson.
We work with IBM because they keep us on the cutting edge of the fan experience.
They help us to adopt the latest technology, like Cloud and AI.
And they bring data to life in a way that's accessible and engaging for our fans.

##### Blockchain and Analytics on the Cloud

Blockchain is a secure, distributed, open technology that can help speed up
processes, lower costs, and build transparency and traceability in
transactional applications.

It is an immutable Network allowing members to view only those transactions that are relevant to them.
The more open, diverse,
and distributed the network, the stronger the trust and transparency in the data
and transactions.

85% of businesses today rely on multiple clouds to meet their IT
needs, with more than 70% using more than three. These businesses need to be able
to move applications and data across multiple clouds easily and securely,
leading to the emerging demand to build and manage business applications such as
blockchain for the multi cloud environment. Blockchain and AI, much like
IoT and AI, powered by the cloud, also have a three-way relationship. Where
blockchain technology provides the trusted, decentralized source of truth, AI
powers the analytics and decision-making from the data collected, and cloud
provides globally distributed, scalable, and cost-efficient computing resources
to support both the unprecedented amounts of data being collected and the
processing power required to draw insights from this data. Blockchain
serves to make AI more understandable by recording the data and variables that go
into a decision made in an AI algorithm, leading to greater trust and
transparency in the conclusions and decisions made by these algorithms. Let's
look at how blockchain on the cloud is helping farmers reduce waste at times of
recall by building traceability and transparency in the food supply chain.

For farmers here, this is our life's work. 60% of the nation's lettuce is
grown right here in Salinas. When it comes down to how plants are looked at, I
really relate back to how humans are raised and nurtured. I want to make sure
that everything is safe before it leaves the ranch. But when a recall happens,
perfectly good food goes to waste. You have to take all product off your shelf,
no matter what age, no matter where it came from. And it takes resources to grow
those things. Now we're actually eating into our future food supply. But
we've gotta way around that. With Blockchain technology on the IBM cloud
we're able to track our product within seconds. Giving the consumers instant
access where the product came from, in case there's any recall so we don't
have to take all the food off the shelves.
Having that instant access allows you to reduce the waste. There's a lot of
starving people in this world. I want to be a generation that
fixes that.

Analytics technologies on the cloud leverage the flexibility, scalability, and
computing resources available on the cloud. From tracking trends on social
media to predict future events, to analyzing data to build machine learning
models that can be deployed in cognitive applications, cloud provides the
integrated environment that is required to leverage data for continuous
improvement and accelerated business growth. Let's look at how KONE has
invested in cloud and IoT technologies to power a data analytics and predictive
maintenance solution for city infrastructure used by more than 1
billion people daily.

At KONE we manufacture elevators, escalators, auto
walks, and doors All of these devices are streams of data that we are collecting.
In order to process those streams, we need a scalable way of handling the amount
of data that is coming in. And that's where cloud function fits in perfectly.
We handle that data with event-driven architecture. We use functions to persist
that data, and to generate further events on that data, that are then utilized and
consumed by applications, our customers and users. In our analytics
platform, we analyzed the set of data and we generate value predictive in a sense
that we can predict the failure rate to a certain percentage that is about to
happen in the future for our equipment. And this allows us to perform predictive
maintenance. And this is kind of the whole concept that we have behind our
24/7 connected services, which is a promise to our customers. That the
equipment is connected to the cloud and we are monitoring it. And that's where we
generate the real a value for our customers. At the
moment we use almost all aspects of the IBM cloud. We use storage from the cloud.
We use cloud function. We use messaging services. We
use IoT services. So a number of services already in use and platform. And that use
will only grow as our digital footprint in the industry grows.

##### Overview of Service Models

In our introductory cloud video we briefly talked about the three service
models available on the cloud.

- Infrastructure as a Service
- Platform as a Service
- Software as a Service

IaaS is a set of compute networking and storage resources that have been virtualized by a vendor so
that a user can access and configure them any way they want. In design we
have a concept of talking about users, called personas, and the persona for IaaS
is a system admin, or an IT admin.

Let's jump up to the top with Software as a
Service that's the easy one. Software as a Service is just software that you
don't have to install on your machine and you don't have to manually update.
And so the user for Software as a Service could be anyone. In fact, if you're
watching this on YouTube right now, then you're a user of Software as a Service.
It's usually charged on a subscription model rather than a one-time license fee.

And that brings us to Platform as a Service. PaaS takes advantage of all the
virtualized resources from Iaas and then just abstracts them away, so the
user doesn't have to worry about managing any of those virtualized
resources. The user for PaaS is not a system admin, usually. It's usually a dev.
At IBM we call this dev, Jane.
That's the name of our persona. And so this whole metaphor, the pyramid metaphor,
is meant to indicate that as you move down, you're increasing complexity in
terms of your knowledge and management of infrastructure resources.
And you're increasing the ease of use.

Another metaphor I use when I'm talking to the designers on my team about PaaS,
is having to do with a car. So in this metaphor IaaS is like leasing
a car. So if you've ever leased a car, you probably did a lot of research, and
you care about the specs of the car and their performance. You care about the
color of the car, what kind of car it is. You're the one driving and you're the one paying
for it. You're also paying for the gas and any tolls or maintenance. With
Platform as a Service in this metaphor, that's more like renting a car. So say
you're on vacation and you just got off at the air Airport and you're going to pick
up your rental car. You don't really care what color it is. You don't even care
about the specs of it, but you're still driving and you're paying for the gas
and any tolls you go through. Software as a Service is again the easiest one. That
one's more like getting a taxi or an uber. So with the taxi or an uber, you
don't care at all about what kind of car it is, what color it is. And in fact,
you're not even the one driving, or paying for gas, or any tolls because
that's baked into the price.

- So let's see what it means in terms of cloud
computing and its three service models with IaaS the cloud provider manages the
physical resources, data centers, cooling power, Network and security, as well as
computing resources that include servers and storage.
- With PaaS, the provider, in
addition to the computing resources, also manages the platform infrastructure
which includes the operating systems, development tools, databases, and business
analytics.
- In the SaaS model, in addition to the infrastructure and the platform
resources, the provider also hosts and manages the applications and data.

##### IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service

In our introductory cloud video, we briefly mentioned the three service models for cloud.
In this video, we will discuss the Infrastructure-as-a-Service model in more detail.
Infrastructure-as-a-Service, commonly referred to as “IaaS,” – or simply “eye-ass”
- is a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental compute, network, and storage
resources to consumers on-demand, over the internet, on a pay-as-you-go basis.

The cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises
data center as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer.

In an IaaS Cloud environment, customers can create or provision virtual machines (or VMs)
in their choice of Region and Zone available from the Cloud Provider.
These VMs typically come pre-installed the customer’s choice of operating system.
The customers can then deploy middleware, install applications, and run workloads on
these VMs.
They can also and create storage for their workloads and backups.
Cloud providers often provide customers the ability to track and monitor the performance
and usage of their cloud services and manage disaster recovery.

Let’s look at the key components of cloud infrastructure:

1. Physical data centers: IaaS providers manage large data centers that contain the physical
machines required to power the various layers of abstraction on top of them.
In most IaaS models, end users do not interact directly with the physical infrastructure
but experience it as a service provided to them.

2. Compute: IaaS providers manage the hypervisors and end-users programmatically provision virtual
instances with desired amounts of compute, memory, and storage resources.
Cloud compute typically comes with supporting services like auto scaling and load balancing
that provide scalability and high performance.

3. Network: Users get access to networking resources on the cloud through virtualization or programmatically,
through APIs.

4. Storage: There are three types of cloud data storage: object, file, and block storage.
Object storage is the most common mode of storage in the cloud, given that it is highly
distributed and resilient.

IaaS supports a wide array of use cases.
We’ll look at some typical use cases here.
Organizations today are using cloud infrastructure services to enable their teams to set up test
and development environments faster, helping create new applications more quickly.
By abstracting the low-level components, cloud infrastructure is helping developers focus
more on business logic than infrastructure management.
Business continuity and disaster recovery require a significant amount of technology
and staff investments.
IaaS is helping organizations reduce this cost and make applications and data accessible
as usual during a disaster or outage.
Organizations are using cloud infrastructure to deploy their web applications faster and
also scale infrastructure up and down as demand fluctuates.
Organizations are leveraging the high-performance computing capabilities of cloud infrastructure
to solve complex problems involving millions of variables and calculations, such as climate
and weather predictions and financial modeling.

Mining massive data sets to locate valuable patterns, trends, and associations requires
a huge amount of processing power.
Cloud infrastructure not only provides the required high-performance computing but also
makes it economically viable.
While there are some concerns regarding the lack of transparency in the cloud infrastructure’s
configuration and management and dependency on a third-party for workload availability
and performance Infrastructure-as-a-Service is the fastest growing cloud model today.

#### PaaS - Platform as a Service

Platform-as-a-Service, commonly referred to as “PaaS,” is a cloud computing model
that provides customers a complete platform—hardware, software, and infrastructure—to develop,
deploy, manage, and run applications created by them or acquired from a third-party.

The PaaS provider hosts everything—servers, networks, storage, operating system, application
runtimes, APIs, middleware, databases, and other tools—at their data center.

The provider also takes responsibility for the installation, configuration, and operation
of the application infrastructure, leaving the user responsible for only the application
code and its maintenance.

Customers pay for this service on a usage basis and purchase resources on-demand.

With IaaS, the cloud provider offers access to ‘raw’ computing resources, such as
servers, storage, and networking, while the user is responsible for the platform and application
software.

With PaaS, the cloud service provider delivers and manages the entire platform infrastructure,
abstracting users from the lower-level details of the environment.

Let’s look at some essential characteristics of Platform-as-a-Service:

PaaS clouds are distinguished by the high level of abstraction they provide to the users,
eliminating the complexity of deploying applications, configuring infrastructure, and provisioning
and configuring supporting technologies like load balancers and databases.

PaaS clouds provide services and APIs that help simplify the job of developers in delivering
elastically scalable and highly available cloud applications.
These services typically include a variety of capabilities such as APIs for distributed
caching, queuing and messaging, file and data storage, workload management, user identity,
and analytics, thus eliminating the need to integrate disparate components.

The PaaS runtime environment executes end-user code according to policies set by the application
owner and cloud provider.
Many of the PaaS offerings provide developers with rapid deployment mechanisms, or “push
and run” mechanism, for deploying and running applications.

PaaS offerings support a range of application infrastructure (or middleware) capabilities,
such as application servers, database management systems, business analytics services, mobile
back-end services, integration services, business process management systems, rules engines,
and complex event processing systems.

Such an application infrastructure assists developers by reducing the amount of code
that must be written while expanding the application’s functional capabilities.
The most important use case for PaaS is strategic—build, test, deploy, enhance, and scale applications
rapidly and cost-effectively.
Let’s look at some more use cases for PaaS: API development and management: Organizations
are using PaaS to develop, run, manage, and secure APIs and microservices, which are loosely
coupled, independently deployable components and services.

Internet of Things, or IoT: PaaS clouds support a broad range of application environments,
programming languages, and tools used for IoT deployments.

Business analytics/intelligence: PaaS tools allow organizations to analyze their data
to find business insights that enable more informed business decisions and predictions.

Business Process Management, or BPM: Organizations are using the PaaS cloud to access BPM platform
delivered as a service.

Master data management, or MDM: Organizations are leveraging the PaaS cloud to provide a
single point of reference for critical business data such as information about customer transactions
and analytical data to support decision making.

Let’s look at some advantages of using PaaS: Scalability, made possible because of the
rapid allocation and deallocation of resources with a pay-as-you-use model offered by PaaS.

The APIs, support services, and middleware capabilities that PaaS clouds provide assist
developers in focusing their efforts on application development and testing, resulting in faster
time to market for their products and services.
Middleware capabilities also reduce the amount of code that needs to be written while expanding
the application’s functional capabilities.
Greater agility and innovation because using PaaS platforms means that you can experiment
with multiple operating systems, languages, and tools without having to invest in these
resources.

You can evaluate and prototype ideas with very low risk exposure resulting in faster,
easier, less-risky adoption of a wider range of resources.

Some of the key PaaS offerings available in the market today include AWS Elastic Beanstalk,
Cloud Foundry on IBM Cloud, IBM Cloud Paks, Windows Azure, RedHat OpenShift, Magento Commerce
Cloud, Force.com, and Apache Stratos.

PaaS clouds do come with some risks—risks that all cloud offerings have in general,
such as information security threats and dependency on the service provider’s infrastructure.
Services can get impacted when a service provider’s infrastructure experiences downtime.
Customers also don’t have any direct control over the changes that may take place when
a provider makes changes in its strategy, service offerings, or tools.
But the benefits can far outweigh these risks—PaaS continues to experience strong growth and
is predicted to become the prevailing platform delivery model moving forward.

##### SaaS - Software as a Service

Software-as-a-Service, “SaaS”, or simply “sass”, is a cloud offering that provides
users with access to a service provider’s cloud-based software.
SaaS providers maintain the servers, databases, and code that constitute an application.
They also manage access to the application, including security, availability, and performance.
Applications reside on a remote cloud network, and users use these applications without having
to maintain and update the infrastructure.

Core business processes supported by SaaS today / include
email and collaboration via offerings such as Microsoft's Office 365 and Google's Gmail,
Customer Relationship Management via services such as NetSuite CRM and Salesforce,
Human Resource Management via services from Workday and SAP SuccessFactors,
financial management, billing and collaboration, and many more.
According to Forrester Research, SaaS has overtaken on-premises solutions in categories
such as human capital management (HCM), customer relationship management (CRM), and collaboration.
Solutions once available with several different deployment options are now SaaS-only.
Let’s look at key characteristics of Software-as-a-Service: SaaS clouds have a multitenant architecture.
Infrastructure and code are maintained centrally and accessed by all users.
SaaS makes it easy for users to manage privileges, monitor data use, and ensure everyone sees
the same information at the same time.
Security, compliance, and maintenance are all part of the offering.
Users can customize applications to fit their business processes with point-and-click ease.
Users can customize the UI to work with their branding guidelines; they can modify data
fields and enable or disable features within the business process.
These customizations are preserved through upgrades.
Users pay for the use of the services via a subscription model.
The use of resources can be scaled easily, depending on service needs.
Key benefits of adopting SaaS: Businesses can directly procure solutions
without upfront capital and assistance from IT, greatly reducing the time from decision
to value from months to days.
SaaS greatly increases workforce productivity and efficiency.
Users can access core business apps from wherever they; they can also buy and deploy apps in
minutes reducing the typical obstacles enterprises have to to test the products they they might
use.
Using SaaS applications, individuals and small enterprises can spread out their software
costs over time.
Let’s look at some use cases for SaaS: Organizations are moving to SaaS for their
core business needs as part of their strategic transformation to reduce on-premises IT infrastructure
and reduce capital expenditure.
Oragnzaitions are leveraging SaaS to avoid the need for ongoing upgrades, maintenance,
and patching, done traditionally by internal IT resources; applications run reliably with
minimal input, for example, email servers and office collaboration and productivity
tools.
Organizations are increasingly opting for SaaS eCommerce Platforms to manage their websites,
marketing, sales, and operations.
With SaaS, organizations are able to take advantage of the resilience and business continuity
of the cloud provider.
Enterprises are now developing SaaS integration platforms (or SIPs) for building additional
SaaS applications, moving SaaS beyond standalone software functionality to a platform for mission-critical
applications.
SaaS does evoke some concerns, as well.
Primary among them being data ownership and data safety.
Security is an important consideration when you’re allowing a third-party to maintain
business-critical data.
And application access relies on a good internet connection—if you’re not connected, you
cannot access the apps.
But the benefits far outweigh the concerns, with SaaS making up the largest segment of
the cloud market today.

##### Public Cloud

In our introductory cloud video, we briefly mentioned the three deployment models for
cloud.

In this video, we will discuss the Public Cloud deployment model in more detail.
Deployment models indicate where the infrastructure resides, who owns and manages it, and how
cloud resources and services are made available to users.

The three cloud deployment models include—Public Cloud, Private Cloud, and Hybrid Cloud.

In a public cloud model, users get access to servers, storage, network, security, and
applications as services delivered by cloud service providers over the internet.
Using web consoles and APIs, users can provision the resources and services they need.
The cloud provider owns, manages, provisions, and maintains the infrastructure, renting
it out to customers either for a subscription charge or usage-based fee.
Users don’t own the servers their applications run on or storage their data consumes, or
manage the operations of the servers, or even determine how the platforms are maintained.
In very much the same way that we consume and pay for utilities such as water, electricity,
or gas in our everyday lives, we don’t own any of these cloud resources—we make an
agreement with the service provider, use the resources, and pay for what we use within
a certain period.

Public clouds offer significant cost savings as the provider bears all the capital, operational,
and maintenance expenses for the infrastructure and the facilities they are hosted in.
It makes scalability as easy as requesting more capacity.
However, with a public cloud, the user does not have any control over the computing environment
and is subject to the performance and security of the cloud provider’s infrastructure.

There are several public cloud providers in the market today, such as Amazon Web Services,
Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Google Cloud Platform, and Alibaba Cloud.
While all providers include a common set of core services, such as servers, storage, network,
security, and databases, they also offer a wide spectrum of niche services with varied
payment options.

Let’s talk about some of the characteristics of a public cloud:

A public cloud is a virtualized multi-tenant architecture enabling tenants or users to
share computing resources, residing outside their firewalls.
The cloud providers pool of resources, including infrastructure, platforms, and software, are
NOT dedicated for use by a single tenant or organization.
Resources are distributed on an as-needed basis offered through a variety of subscription
and pay-as-you-go models.

Public clouds have significant benefits; we’ll go over some of these benefits here:

- Vast on-demand resources are available, allowing applications to respond seamlessly to fluctuations
in demand.
- Considering the large number of users that share the centralized cloud resources on-demand,
the public cloud offers the most significant economies of scale.
- The sheer number of server and network resources available on the public cloud means that a
public cloud is highly reliable—if one physical component fails, the service still runs unaffected
on the remaining available components.

It’s also important to note some concerns users have regarding public clouds—key among
them being security and data sovereignty compliance.
Security issues such as data breaches, data loss, account hijacking, insufficient due
diligence, and system and application vulnerability seem to be some of the fears users continue
to have concerning security in the public cloud.
With data being stored in different locations and accessed across national borders, it has
also become increasingly critical for companies to be compliant with data sovereignty regulations
governing the storage, transfer, and security of data.
A service provider’s ability to not just keep up with the regulations, but also the
interpretation of these regulations, is a concern shared by many businesses.

Let’s look at some common use cases for public cloud:

- Organizations are increasingly opting to access cloud-based applications and platforms so
their teams can focus on building and testing applications, and reducing time-to-market
for their products and services.
- Businesses with fluctuating capacity and resourcing needs are opting for the public cloud.
- Organizations are using public cloud computing resources to build secondary infrastructures
for disaster recovery, data protection, and business continuity.

More and more organizations are using cloud storage and data management services for greater
accessibility, easy distribution, and backing up their data.
IT departments are outsourcing the management of less critical and standardized business
platforms and applications to pubic cloud providers.

##### Private Cloud

The National Institute of Standards and Technology defines Private Cloud as cloud infrastructure
provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers,
such as the business units within the organization.
It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination
of them, and it may exist on or off premises.”

Private cloud platforms can be implemented internally or externally.

1. When the platform is provisioned over an organization’s internal infrastructure, it runs on-premises
and is owned, managed, and operated by the organization.

2. When it is provisioned over a cloud provider’s infrastructure, it is owned, managed, and
operated by the service provider.

- Virtual Private Cloud, or VPC.

This external private cloud offering that resides on a cloud service provider’s infrastructure
is called a Virtual Private Cloud, or VPC.
A VPC is a public cloud offering that lets an organization establish its own private
and secure cloud-like computing environment in a logically isolated part of a shared public
cloud.
Using a VPC, organizations can leverage the dynamic scalability, high availability, and
lower cost of ownership of a public cloud, while having the infrastructure and security
tailored to the organization’s unique needs.
Virtual Private Clouds are offered by most Public Cloud providers such as IBM and Amazon.
A private cloud is a virtualized environment modeled to bring in the benefits of a public
cloud platform without the perceived disadvantages of an open and shared public platform.

Users of a private cloud, such as Developers and Business Units in an organization, still
get to leverage benefits such as economies of scale, granular scale, operational efficiencies,
and user self-service, while exercising full control over access, security, and compliances
specific to their organization and business.

Private clouds provide you with The ability to leverage the value of cloud
computing using systems that are directly managed or under perceived control of the
organization’s internal IT.

The ability to better utilize internal computing resources, such as the organization’s existing
investments in hardware and software, thereby reducing costs.
Better scalability through virtualization and “cloud bursting,” i.e., leveraging
public cloud instances for a period of time but returning to the private cloud when the
surge is met.

Controlled access and greater security measures customized to specific organizational needs.
The ability to expand and provision things in a relatively short amount of time, providing
greater agility.
Organizations may choose to opt for private cloud because of various reasons—because
their applications provide a unique competitive advantage, there are security and regulatory
concerns, or because the data is highly sensitive and subject to strict industry or governmental
regulations.

Let’s look at some common use cases for a private cloud:

- A private cloud is an opportunity for organizations to modernize and unify their in-house and
legacy applications.
- Moving these applications from their dedicated hardware to the cloud also allows them to
leverage the power of the compute resources and multiple services available on the cloud.

Using the private cloud, organizations are integrating data and application services
from their existing applications with public cloud services.
This allows them to leverage their private cloud’s compute capability for the larger
jobs while pulling data into an application on a private cloud to leverage public cloud
services—essentially opening their data centers to work with cloud services.
Application portability is a key feature of cloud platforms.

Using the private cloud gives organizations the flexibility to build applications anywhere,
and move them anywhere, without having to compromise security and compliance in the
process.

Some of the key reasons that may prevent an organization from moving to a public cloud
include security and regulatory concerns, and data sensitivity.
A private cloud offers these organizations the benefits of on-demand enterprise resources
while exercising full control over critical security and compliance issues from within
the environment of their dedicated cloud.

##### Hybrid Cloud

Hybrid cloud is a computing environment that connects an organization’s on-premise private
cloud and third-party public cloud into a single, flexible infrastructure for running
the organization’s applications and workloads.
The mix of public and private cloud resources gives organizations the flexibility to choose
the optimal cloud for each application or workload.
Workloads move freely between the two clouds as needs change.
Organizations can choose to run the sensitive, highly-regulated, and mission-critical applications
or workloads with reasonably constant performance and capacity requirements on private cloud
infrastructure while deploying the less-sensitive and more-dynamic workloads on the public cloud.
With proper integration and orchestration between the public and private clouds, you
can leverage both clouds for the same workload.

For example, you can leverage additional public cloud capacity to accommodate a spike in demand
for a private cloud application (also known as “cloud bursting”).

The key tenets of a hybrid cloud are interoperability, scalability, and portability.

1. Hybrid cloud is interoperable—which means that the public and private cloud services
can understand each other’s APIs, configuration, data formats, and forms of authentication
and authorization.

2. When there is a spike in demand, a workload running on the private cloud can leverage
the additional public cloud capacity, making it scalable.

3. A hybrid cloud is also portable—since you’re no longer locked-in with a specific vendor,
you can move applications and data not just between on-premise and cloud systems, but
also between cloud service providers.

Hybrid is about taking the best of both worlds.

There are 2 common types of hybrid clouds: Hybrid monocloud and Hybrid multicloud.

- A hybrid monocloud is a hybrid cloud with one cloud provider, while a hybrid multicloud
is an open standards-based stack that can be deployed on any public cloud infrastructure.
The difference lies in the flexibility that the hybrid multicloud offers organizations
to move workloads and environments from one vendor to another.

- There is also a variant of hybrid multicloud, called the composite multicloud, which makes
this flexibility even more granular as it distributes single applications across multiple
providers, allowing you to move application components across cloud services and vendors
as needed.

Hybrid cloud offers significant benefits in areas of security and compliance, scalability
and resilience, resource optimization and cost-saving.

A hybrid cloud lets organizations deploy highly regulated or sensitive workloads in a private
cloud while running the less-sensitive workloads on a public cloud.
Using a hybrid cloud, you can scale up quickly, inexpensively, and even automatically using
the public cloud infrastructure, all without impacting the other workloads running on your
private cloud.
Because you’re not locked-in with a specific vendor and also don’t have to make either-or
decisions between the different cloud models, you can make the most cost-efficient use of
your infrastructure budget.
You can maintain workloads where they are most efficient, spin-up environments using
pay-as-you-go in the public cloud, and rapidly adopt new tools as you need them.

A typical organization will have a range of applications and workloads spread across private,
public, and traditional IT environments.
This represents a range of opportunities for optimization via a hybrid cloud approach.

Let’s look at some increasingly common hybrid cloud use cases:

- Software-as-a-Service integration.
Through hybrid integration, organizations are connecting Software-as-a-Service applications
available in the public cloud to their existing public cloud, private cloud, and traditional
IT applications to deliver new solutions.

- Data and AI integration.
Organizations today are creating richer and more personal experiences by combining new
data sources on the public cloud—such as weather, social, the Internet of Things, CRM,
and ERP—with existing data and analytics, machine learning, and AI capabilities.

- Enhancing legacy apps.
An increasing number of organizations are using public cloud services to upgrade the
user experience of their on-premises applications and deploy them globally to new devices, while
incrementally modernizing their core business systems.

- VMware migration.
More and more organizations are “lifting and shifting” their on-premises virtualized
workloads to a public cloud without conversion or modification to reduce their on-premises
data center footprint and position themselves to scale without added capital expense.

##### Summary

- Cloud computing allows us to utilize technology as a service, leveraging remote resources on-demand, on a pay-as-you-model. There are three main service models available on the cloud—Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).

```
o   IaaS provides the fundamental compute, network, and storage resources for customers on-demand.

o   PaaS provides customers the hardware, software, and infrastructure to develop, deploy, manage, and run applications created by them or acquired from a third-party.

o   SaaS provides access to users to a service provider’s cloud-based software. Users simply access the applications on Cloud while the Cloud provider maintains the infrastructure, platform, data, application code, security, availability, and performance of the application.
```

- Deployment models indicate where the infrastructure resides, who owns and manages it, and how cloud resources and services are made available to users. There are three main deployment models available on the cloud—Public, Private, and Hybrid.

```
o   In the Public cloud model, the service provider owns, manages, provisions, and maintains the physical infrastructure such as data centers, servers, networking equipment, and storage, with users accessing virtualized compute, networking, and storage resources as services.

o   In the Private cloud model, the provider provisions the cloud infrastructure for exclusive use by a single organization. The private cloud infrastructure can be internal to the organization and run or on-premises. Or, it can be on a public cloud, as in the case of Virtual Private Clouds (VPC) and be owned, managed, and operated by the cloud provider.

o   In the Hybrid cloud model, an organization’s on-premise private cloud and third-party, public cloud is connected as a single, flexible infrastructure leveraging the features and benefits of both Public and Private clouds.

#### MODULE_4_COMPONENTS_OF_CLOUD_COMPUTING

```
- Overview of Cloud Infrastructure
```

##### Overview of Cloud Infrastructure

After choosing the cloud service model and the cloud type offered by vendors, customers
need to plan the infrastructure architecture.

The infrastructure layer is the foundation of the cloud.

This layer consists of physical resources that are housed in Regions, Zones and Data
Centers.
A Cloud provider’s IT environment is typically distributed across many Regions around the
world.

A cloud Region, is a geographic area or location where a Cloud provider’s infrastructure
is clustered, and may have names like NA South or US East.
The cloud Regions are isolated from each other so that if one Region was impacted by a natural
disaster like an Earthquake, the Cloud operations in other Regions would keep running.
Each Cloud Region can have multiple Zones (or Availability Zones or AZ for short), which
are typically distinct Data Centers with their own power, cooling and networking resources.

These Zones can have names like DAL-09 or us-east-1.

The isolation of zones improves the cloud’s overall fault tolerance, decreases latency,
and avoids creating a single shared point of failure.
The Availability Zones (and DataCenters within them) are connected to other AZs and regions,
private datacenters and the Internet using very high bandwidth network connectivity.
A cloud Data center is a huge room or a warehouse containing cloud infrastructure.
These data centers contain pods and racks or standardized containers of computing resources
such as servers, as well as storage, and networking equipment - virtually everything that a physical
IT environment has.

Computing Resources: Cloud providers offer several compute options
– Virtual Servers, Bare Metal Servers, and “Serverless” computing resources.
Most of the servers in a cloud datacenter run hypervisors to create virtual servers
or virtual machines (also called VMs for short), that are software-based computers, based on
virtualization technologies.
Other servers in the racks are bare metal servers that are physical servers that aren’t
virtualized.
Customers can provision VMs and Bare Metals servers as and when they need them and run
their workloads on them.
Cloud users can also run their workloads on serverless computing resources, which are
an abstraction layer on top of virtual machines.

We will talk about all three compute options in greater detail in subsequent videos.

1. Storage: Information and data can consist of files,
code, documents, images, videos, backups, snapshots, and databases and can be stored
in many different types of storage options on the Cloud.
Bare Metal Servers and Virtual Servers are provisioned with default storage in local
drives.
Since these cloud servers can be provisioned and decommissioned by customers on demand
and freed up for use by other users, any information stored in a local drive can be lost when you
delete or decommission a cloud server.
However there are other storage options available on the cloud to persist data that you can
choose depending on factors like how important your data is, how quickly you want to be able
to access it, how often you access it, and how secure you need it to be.

These additional storage options include Block storage, File storage, and Object storage.

- Block and file storage modes are commonly used in traditional data centers, but “often
struggle with scale, performance and distributed characteristics of cloud.”

- Object storage is the most common mode of storage in the cloud as it’s both highly
distributed and resilient.

We will examine Object Storage and the other storage options in more detail in later videos.

2. Networking: Networking infrastructure in a cloud datacenter
includes traditional networking hardware like routers and switches, but more importantly
for users of the Cloud, the Cloud providers have Software Defined Networking (or SDN)
options where certain networking resources are virtualized or made available programmatically,
through APIs.
This allows for easier network provisioning, configuration, and management in the cloud.
When servers in the cloud are provisioned, you need to setup their public and private
network interfaces.
The public network interfaces, as the name suggests, connect the servers to the public
internet, whereas the private ones provide connectivity to your other cloud resources
and help keep them secure.
As in the physical IT world, network interfaces in the cloud need to have IP addresses and
subnets either assigned automatically or configured.
In a cloud environment it is even more important to configure which network traffic and users
can access your resources, which can be done by setting up Security Groups and Access Control
Lists (or ACLs).
For further security and isolation of your resources in the cloud, most Cloud providers
provide Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), and Virtual
Private Networks (VPNs).
Some of the traditional hardware appliances such as firewalls, load balancers, gateways
and traffic analyzers can also be virtualized and made available as services in the cloud.
Another networking capability provided by the Cloud Providers is Content Delivery Networks
or CDNs, that distribute content to multiple points throughout the world so users accessing
the content can access it more quickly by getting it from a point nearest to them.
We will learn more about some of these cloud networking options and terminology in subsequent
videos.
Cloud infrastructure is constantly advancing and improving.

##### Virtualization and Virtual Machines Explained

Hi. My name is Kaleigh Bovey, with the IBM Cloud team and today we're going to be
talking about virtualization. As you know virtualization is a fairly old
technology, but it's still super relevant to building our cloud computing strategy
today.

So, first off, what is virtualization?

Simply put, virtualization
is the process of creating a software based, or virtual, version of something,
whether that be compute, storage, networking, servers, or applications. And
what makes virtualization feasible, is something called the hypervisor. We're
going to write that here. What a hypervisor is, is it's simply a piece of
software that runs above the physical server, or host. And there are a couple
different types of hypervisors out there. What they do is essentially pull the
resources from the physical server and allocate them to your virtual
environments.

There are two main types of hypervisors out there.

- One being Type 1. Very simple to remember.
- And 2, you guessed it, Type 2.

So let's start
with Type 1.

A Type 1 hypervisor is a hypervisor that
is installed directly on top of the physical server. They're also called
bare-metal hypervisors. So we'll write that up here. Remember these are the most
frequently typed of use hypervisors and they're most secure, they lower the
latency, and these are the ones that you'll see in the market the most. Some
examples would be VMware, ESXi, or Microsoft Hyper-v, or even open-source
KVM.

The other type of hypervisor is a Type 2 hypervisor, over here. And what
makes these different is that there is a layer of host OS that sits between the
physical server and the hypervisor. By that nature they are also called, Hosted.
Hhese are a lot less frequent. They're mostly used for end-user virtualization.
You might see some in the market that are called: Oracle, VirtualBox,
or VMware Workstation. Again, they're a lot less frequent. They're a bit more...
They have a higher latency than a Type 1 hypervisor. So once you have your
hypervisor installed, you can build virtual environments, or virtual machines,
or simply put, VMs. So let's spin up some environments.

What makes a VM a VM? A VM is simply a software based computer. They're run like
a physical computer. They have an operating system and applications, and
they're completely independent of one another, but you can run multiple of them
on a hypervisor. And the hypervisor manages the resources that are allocated
to these virtual environments from the physical server. Because they're
independent you can run different operating systems on different virtual
machines. You could run Windows here, or Linux here, or UNIX here for example.
Because they're independent they're also extremely portable. You can move a
virtual machine from one hypervisor to another hypervisor on a completely
different machine almost instantaneously, which gives you a lot of
flexibility and a lot of portability within your environment. So looking at
all of this - this is the core virtualization as a process. So let's
talk about a couple key benefits that you want to take away from this. 1) Cost
savings.

When you think about this and the fact that you can run multiple virtual
environments from one piece of infrastructure, means that you can
drastically reduce your physical infrastructure footprint. This is
consolidation at its core. And the fact that you don't have to maintain nearly
as many servers, run as much electricity, save on maintenance costs, means that you
save on your bottom line at the end of the day. 2) Would
be agility and speed. Like I said, spinning up a virtual machine is
relatively easy and quick - a lot more simple than provisioning an entire new
environment for your developers if they say they want to spin up a new
environment so that they can run a test scenario. Whatever it might be,
virtualization makes that process a lot simpler and quicker. And 3) lowers
your downtime.

Let's say that this host goes out unexpectedly. The fact that you can move
virtual machines from one hypervisor to another, on a different physical server,
means that you have a great backup plan in place. Right? So, if this host goes down
you can simply move your VMs very quickly to another hypervisor on a
machine that is working. Virtualization and VMs are at the center of cloud
computing and provide many benefits.
