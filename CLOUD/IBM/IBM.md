#### INTRO

Welcome to introduction to cloud computing, the first in the series of
four courses designed to give you the foundational skills you need to be a
cloud practitioner. Today cloud represents a huge market, one that is
continuing to grow at an unprecedented scale. Enormous computational power, once
considered a prerogative of large enterprises, is now available at the
fingertips of even the smallest of businesses and individual developers,
thanks to Cloud.

Moreover, the Cloud makes all this computational power highly affordable
with pay-as-you-go economics. If you look at some of the key emerging technologies
of our times, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things,
Blockchain and Analytics, all of these technologies work with massive amounts
of data and need huge storage space and computational power in order to work -
making cloud possibly the only viable platform for these technologies.

This course will introduce you to the core concepts of cloud computing - from its
essential characteristics to the different service and deployment models,
cloud architecture, security and monitoring, emerging technologies
supported by the cloud, and career opportunities available in the domain.

The course is designed for everyone - it doesn't matter if you have a background
in cloud technologies. Whether you're an IT person looking to upscale or explore
this domain, a fresh graduate looking to make a career in cloud technologies, or
an IT decision-maker, this course will equip you with what you need to get
started. With just the public cloud service market expected to grow to 331.2
billion by 2022, it's a time to be in the cloud computing
industry. Today there are more open positions in cloud than the number of
skilled people available. And the sheer growth of the cloud market makes it an
exciting and dependable career prospect for the coming times. So, congratulations
on embarking on this exciting journey. And good luck!
