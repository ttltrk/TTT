#### The Cloud and why people use it

```
In The Cloud, you should have learned:

- Cloud computing is on-demand network access to shared resources.
- The cloud deployment models are public, private, and hybrid.

In Characteristics and Benefits of Cloud Computing, you should have learned:

- The five characteristics of cloud computing are on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service.
- One of the benefits of cloud computing is cost-effectiveness.
- It is also efficient and flexible since there are prebuilt tools and storage options available for the clients. Cloud computing allows users to collaborate and quickly get their products out to the public.
- Concepts like virtual private cloud, encryption, and API keys can ensure data is secure. Data loss does not occur because of backups in the cloud.
```

##### What is cloud computing?

The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud computing as "a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction." Examples of computing resources include networks, servers, storage, applications, and services. Cloud computing also includes three types of cloud deployment models: public, private, and hybrid.

##### Why People Use Cloud Computing

People use cloud computing because of its convenience, reliability, affordability, and accessibility. It helps facilitate the management of data, security, storage, compliance, and applications, to name a few.  In addition, the transformational technology associated with the cloud enables new and emerging trends to materialize further expanding its usage. One way users can take advantage of cloud computing is using the agility that the cloud provides to react more quickly to changing business demands. Cloud computing gives rapid access to IT resources compared to more traditional IT approaches allowing new or additional IT services to be provisioned on-demand.

##### Characteristics of Cloud Computing

```
On Demand Self-Service
- Provisioning or de-provisioning computing resources as needed through a simple interface without any human intervention.

Broad Network Access
– Access computing facilities from anywhere over a network by using mechanisms and platforms such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and workstations.

Resource Pooling
– Resources are dynamically assigned and/or allocated to meet the client's demands. Typically the client is not concerned about the physical location of the resources but may specify the country or region if that is a requirement.

Rapid Elasticity
– Allow access for more resources when there is a surge of traffic in the cloud and scale back and release the resources when it is not needed.  

Measured Service
– The client only pays for the resources that they use.
```

##### Benefits of Cloud Computing

- cost
- flexible
- efficient
- secure

#### The History and Evolution of the Cloud

```
In History of the Cloud, you should have learned:

- The foundation for cloud computing started in the 1950s.
- IBM invented virtualization in the 1960s.
- The Intel 4004 chip was mass-produced in the 1970s.
- IBM invented the PC in the 1980s.
- Over a million people were connected to the internet in the early 1990s.
- Server virtualization became common in the 2000s.
- Edge and Fog computing are emerging technologies made possible by cloud.

In Virtualization and Containers, you should have learned:

- Virtualization allows a single, physical, host computer to support a number of virtual 'guests' that have their own, independent, operating system.
- Some types of virtualization are:

    - Desktop virtualization, which includes virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and local desktop virtualization.
    - Network virtualization, which includes software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV).
    - Application virtualization, which includes local application virtualization, application streaming, and server-based application virtualization.
    - Server virtualization, which allows for multiple virtual servers to share the same hardware via a hypervisor.

- The benefits of virtualization are resource efficiency, easier management, minimal downtime, and faster provisioning.
- Containers are software that contains the necessary components to run in any environment without the need for physical components. It is portable and lightweight and streamlined to work in any environment.

In Serverless, you should have learned:

- Serverless environments are built on a server infrastructure, however, they are invisible in the sense that the clients do not see, manage, or interact with the servers.
- Serverless allows developers to focus on their apps instead of having to focus on managing servers.
```

##### A Brief History of the Cloud

Cloud computing is an evolution of technology that dates back to the 1950s. Cloud computing would not exist without utilizing computer hardware and virtualization, a concept that was pioneered by IBM. Virtualization uses software that divides the hardware elements of a single computer into multiple virtual computers, also known as virtual machines (VMs). Cloud computing has also undergone many phases including grid, utility, and on-demand computing.

##### What is virtualization?

Virtualization is the foundation for cloud computing. It is the process of creating a software version of a physical computing resource. Virtualization uses software to create a layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a computer, such as processors, memory, storage, etc., to be divided into multiple computers, or virtual machines (VMs), which are virtual environments that use software to mimic a physical computer.

##### Types of Virtualization

There are different types of virtualization, some of them include desktop, network, application, and server virtualization.

```
Desktop virtualization allows for running multiple desktop operating systems on the same computer in their own VM. There are two types of desktop virtualization: virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) and local desktop virtualization.

Network Virtualization uses software to create an overview of the network that an administrator can use to manage it without needing access to the physical components. It takes the hardware elements and functions and abstracts them into the software. There are two types of network virtualization: software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV).

Application virtualization runs application software without needing it to be installed in the OS, so users can access an application on a separate computer than on the one that the application was originally installed on. There are three types of application virtualization, local application virtualization, application streaming, and server-based application virtualization.

Server virtualization allows multiple virtual 'guest' servers to share the same physical hardware. This works by installing software called a hypervisor, which then controls shared access for each virtual guest to the physical components of the server, including CPU, memory, disk, and networking.
```

##### Benefits of Virtualization

- Resource Efficiency
- Easier Management
- Minimal Downtime
- Faster Provisioning

##### What are containers?

A container is an executable unit of software that packages up all application code and necessary libraries it needs so that it can run reliably in different computing environments. This allows developers to create containerized applications and deploy them simply, with zero changes, in multiple locations. Containers inherit much of their functionality from the underlying platform on which they are running.

##### Benefits of Containers

- Portable, lightweight, and scalable.
- Continuous Integration and Delivery, which is a set of processes that help software development teams deliver code changes more frequently and reliably.
- Streamline development and deployment of cloud-native applications.
- Includes application's code, system tools and libraries, runtime, and settings.

##### What is serverless computing?

As cloud computing evolves, new models of service delivery have evolved, particularly in the compute space. For example, Serverless is a cloud execution model that offloads management responsibility, such as patching, provisioning, scheduling, and scaling to cloud providers while developers can spend their time and effort on coding or building their applications. Serverless automatically provisions the computing resources required to run application code on-demand and automatically scales resources up or down in response to demand and scales resources to zero when the application stops running.

#### The Job Roles that Support Cloud

There are many job roles that organizations can implement in their environment to support IBM Cloud. Identifying the responsibilities of each of these roles and the right individuals in these roles will create success for an organization.

---

#### The Established Cloud Deployment Models

```
The Department for Work and Pensions - (DWP)
A cloud services provider - (CSP)
```

The most widely known cloud deployment models are:

- public cloud
- private cloud
- virtual private cloud
- hybrid cloud

##### Public Cloud

A public cloud provides access to computing resources for multiple users over the internet. Users can access servers, storage, network, security, and applications that are owned and managed by a cloud service provider. Resources are paid for by subscription or per use pricing.

Some benefits of public cloud are:

- A public cloud is very reliable because there are many available servers and networks.
- Users can easily predict recurring operating expenses by using on-demand resources and only paying for what is used.
- The cloud provider owns the data centers, hardware, and infrastructure on which customer workloads are run and is responsible for all maintenance.

##### Private Cloud

A private cloud (also known as an internal cloud or corporate cloud) is a cloud computing environment in which all hardware and software resources are dedicated exclusively to, and accessible by, a single customer and can be accessed either on or off premises. It can be owned, operated, and managed by a third party, the organization itself, or a combination of both.

Some benefits of private cloud are:

- A user has exclusive access to the cloud computing resources.
- There is greater control over resources, data security, and regulatory compliance.
- Applications and the infrastructure are more easily customized.

##### Hybrid Cloud

A hybrid cloud provides a combination of a public and private cloud infrastructure in a single infrastructure.

Some of the benefits of a hybrid cloud are:

- Users can choose either cloud environment, public or private, for each individual application or workload.  
- Sensitive data and applications can be easily separated and run in an on-premises data center.
- Workloads are easily moved between public and private cloud infrastructure.

Some organizations use the term hybrid cloud when combining cloud and non-cloud or traditional infrastructure.

#### Major Cloud Service Models

```
SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS are the major cloud service models.
A ready to use infrastructure and software application are provided by SaaS.
Customers use PaaS to build, test, run, and update applications quickly.
Customers use IaaS to get access to infrastructure resources such as compute, storage, and networking.
```

##### SaaS - Software as a service

SaaS provides a ready to use infrastructure and software application. The SaaS vendor manages all of the upgrades and maintenance. Users simply create an account, pay a subscription fee, and can start using applications immediately.

Some advantages of SaaS:

- Users can try products on a free trial or for a low monthly fee with minimal financial risk.
- Apps can be accessed over the internet on any device with a browser.
- It is easy to add additional users and storage.

##### PaaS - Platform as a service

PaaS helps developers build, test, run, and update applications quickly and inexpensively without having to manage a hardware platform. However, there is not much control over changes made by the provider. The cloud provider hosts all servers, storage, operating system software, databases, and development tools in their data center, providing a fully functioning development environment.

Some advantages of PaaS:

- Hardware and software do not need to be purchased to build and maintain an application development platform because the cloud provider manages the entire platform.  
- More choices for development tools and databases are available.
- Additional compute, storage, and networking capacity can be purchased quickly and used immediately.

##### IaaS - Infrastracture as a service

IaaS provides infrastructure resources such as compute, storage, security, and networking on demand. It allows users to increase or decrease resources, as needed. The cloud provider only manages physical compute resources, data centers, network, and security resources. Control over resources is limited.

Some advantages of IaaS:

- Customers receive pre-virtualized compute, network, and storage resources.
- Users can provision, test, and scale resources quickly.
- IaaS providers are in many locations around the world, reducing latency and improving performance.

##### CaaS - Container as a service

It is worth mentioning that container as a service (CaaS) is another cloud service model often used. It is container based virtualization. The cloud provider delivers container engines, orchestration, and underlying compute resources to users.

#### Emergent Cloud Deployment Models

```
In Distributed Cloud, you should have learned that:

- Distributed cloud allows users to run public cloud services in multiple locations.
- IBM Cloud Satellite is a distributed cloud solution.
- Users can run workloads close to where the data is created using edge computing.
- Distributed cloud enables the processing of data, such as personal data, in a specific location, which helps meet regulatory compliance.

In Multicloud, you should have learned that:

- Multicloud users can use cloud services from more than one cloud vendor.
- Users choose a combination of pricing, performance, security, and compliance requirements from different cloud providers.
- When there is an outage on one cloud, it may not impact services offered on another cloud.
- Many organizations use a hybrid multicloud.
```

##### Distributed Cloud

Distributed cloud is a cloud computing model that enables users to run public cloud services in multiple locations. Locations can be on premises, in a cloud provider's data center, in third-party, or colocation centers. Everything can be managed in a single control plane.

IBM offers a distributed cloud solution with IBM Cloud® Satellite. It helps users deploy and run applications across on premises, edge computing, and public cloud environments.

##### Edge Computing

Edge Computing is the process of running workloads close to where the data is created. Data does not have to be moved to a central cloud data center for processing and then back to where process automation occurs. As a result, applications can process large amounts of data very quickly, in real time.

##### Multicloud

Multicloud is a cloud computing model that refers to using cloud services from more than one cloud vendor. Businesses often use platform as a service (PaaS) or infrastructure as a service (IaaS) from multiple cloud service providers, such as IBM Cloud and Microsoft Azure. They may even use software as a service (SaaS) from different cloud providers, such as Salesforce and Workday.

---

#### IBM Cloud Interface

##### IBM Cloud Console

The IBM Cloud console is an interface where users can access, reference, and manage cloud resources. The cloud console also provides access to the IBM Cloud catalog, cloud documents, IBM support center, the cost estimator tool, IBM Cloud shell, and account management tools.

When a user has an account and is logged into IBM Cloud, the cloud console provides the means to create resources from the dashboard. From the dashboard, users can easily access documentation, the cloud services catalog, see billing information, and seek support.

---

#### The Structure of IBM Cloud

```
In Single-Zone Regions, you should have learned that:
- SZRs provide only one availability zone for a region.
- Resources remain in the same zone where a cluster is deployed.
- Resources in an SZR cannot be spread across zones.
- SZR locations are in India and South Korea.

In Multizone Regions, you should have learned that:
- Three or more zones form a multizone region.
- Cloud services are consistent across zones.
- If a network failure occurs, data is automatically redirected to an alternative zone.
- Services in MZRs have better resiliency and connection speed.

In Data Centers, you should have learned that:
- Data centers are large warehouses or rooms.
- Each data center contains a pod of infrastructure equipment.
- Data center locations are not isolated from multizone regions.
- Each data center contains infrastructure resources used for services and apps.
```

##### Single-Zone Regions

A single-zone region (SZR), as its name implies, is a region made up of one availability zone. While resources in this zone are highly available, an SZR does not provide fault tolerance during failure events when the entire zone is affected. Cloud resources deployed from an SZR are unavailable during a failure event because resources cannot be spread across zones.

SZR locations are:

- Seoul, South Korea
- Chennai, India

##### Multizone Regions

Many IBM Cloud services are deployed into multizone regions to provide high availability. Three or more zones form a multizone region (MZR). Each zone is independent from the others and the network links between have low latency and high bandwidth. Spreading workloads across three zones increases availability to 99.99% compared to single zone deployment.

##### Data Centers

Within a region, one or more data centers are found in a metropolitan city. These sites support classic infrastructure. Each data center is a large warehouse or room that contains pods which are standardized containers of infrastructure equipment. This includes the power, cooling, compute, network, and storage resources used for services and apps.

---

#### Security Measures and Security Options

```
In How IBM Cloud Ensures Security Readiness, you should have learned that:
- The cloud platform provides layers of security controls.
- IBM security policies are driven by best practices for systems, networking, and secure engineering.
- Third party security firms are also used to assess the cloud platform security and compliance.
- Customers can conduct their own security testing for their resources.
- IBM Cloud adheres to industry standards such as CSA, FISA, and MTCS.

In Encryption and IBM Cloud, you should have learned that:
- All data is encrypted in transit.
- Encryption options include BYOK and KYOK.
- Encryption key life cycle events are monitored using the IBM Cloud activity tracker.
- IBM owned keys are used in most services.

In Shared Responsibility, you should have learned that:
- Responsibility for managing and securing products in IBM Cloud is shared by IBM and customers.
- Identity and access management tasks include access control policies.
- Customers are responsible for all data and applications when tasks are completed for products.
```

##### Compliance Programs

IBM shows commitment to protecting customer data and applications through compliance and trust certifications. Some of the industry standards that IBM Cloud adheres to are:

- The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) promotes security assurance best practices in cloud computing by providing the Security, Trust, and Assurance Registry (STAR). STAR documents security controls provided by cloud compute resources. IBM Cloud platform services have a level 1 CSA STAR registration.

- The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) ensures federal government data is secure by requiring programs to conduct annual reviews of information security programs. IBM Cloud for Government holds a FISMA Impact Level High certification.

- The Multi-Tier Cloud Security (MTCS), Singapore Standard SS 584, is a regional compliance standard that IBM Cloud platform services help meet. Cloud service providers operating in Singapore must adhere to this security standard.

---

#### Industry Compliance Standards

- The IBM Cloud platform and services are built to be secure, trustworthy, and meet the needs of industry standards.
- The cloud is designed with secure engineering practices and layered security.
- Cloud users can enable additional layers of security on their cloud to meet compliance regulations.
- Enabling EU support on a cloud account ensures support tickets are sent to IBM support teams in Europe.

---

#### Account types

```
IBM Cloud account types include Pay-Go, Subscription, and Enterprise:

- Pay-As-You-Go, sometimes called just Pay-Go, lets users explore the full catalog of IBM Cloud services and pay for only the ones they wish to use, such as cloud object storage, cloud databases, and artificial intelligence (AI) services.

- With subscription accounts, customers commit to pay a minimum amount per month for a specific duration. The longer the duration, the greater the discount.

- IBM Cloud Enterprise accounts are designed for organizations that need to centrally manage billing and usage across multiple accounts.
```

IBM manages its services via accounts, comprised of systems and components that define the relationship among the resources each user and user group can access.

##### Pay-go accounts are best for users who:

- Want to explore IBM Cloud for free.
- Do not want to make a long-term commitment.
- Do not use traditional severities or require a response within a specific time.

##### Subscription

Subscription accounts offer all of the IBM Cloud services as Pay-go, but add predictability and discounts for platform services. Customers commit to pay a minimum amount per month for a specific duration. The longer the duration, the greater the discount.

##### Enterprise

An Enterprise account is a type of subscription account, which gathers multiple accounts into a single entity to centrally manage billing and usage across an organization.  As such, it’s not technically an "account type," but a construct designed to simplify account management.

Users with Enterprise accounts can:

- Create nested, multi-tiered hierarchies of accounts, broken out by geography, department or whatever structure best fits the organization.
- View invoicing and payment across the enterprise, with a shared subscription credit pool.
- View details about usage and costs.

---

#### Support Plans

```
The three kinds of support plans (basic, advanced, and premium) all have different levels of service.

- Basic: for non-production environments that do not require short response times.
- Advanced: for environments with a limited number of business-critical applications.
- Premium: for mission-critical environments that have a strategic dependency on IBM Cloud.
```

---

#### Identify and Access Management !!!

```
In IAM Defined, you should have learned that:
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables customers to securely authenticate users for platform services and control access to resources across the IBM Cloud platform.
- IAM uses access policies to assign users and service IDs access to the resources within an enterprise account.
- Access policies are how users, service IDs, and access groups in an account are given permission to access and take actions on account resources. Policies include a subject, target, and role.
- The value of using a single resource group and a single access group containing all the users that need the resources in the resource group, is a single policy can be configured that grants access to all resources in the resource group.  
- Customers requiring enhanced security can require multifactor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security to an account by requiring all users to authenticate using an additional authentication factor beyond an ID and password.

In Assigning Access to Resources, you should have learned that:
- To assign access to resources in IAM, the account administrator must identify or create access groups, invite users to the account, and then manage the user access.

In Service and Platform Roles, you should have learned that:
- Service access roles define a user or service’s ability to perform actions on a service instance, such as accessing the console or performing API calls. There are three possible service access roles: manager, writer, and reader.
- Platform management roles cover a range of actions, including the ability to create and delete instances, manage aliases, bindings, and credentials, and manage access. These roles, as the name suggests, enable management of the platform itself. Through them, users are granted a number of privileges, including the ability to create instances, manage service IDs, manage users and permissions, and create resource groups.

In IAM Scenario: Three Teams Working on Three Projects, you should have learned that:
- Account administrators require account to All Identity and Access services and the specific platform access role for administrators.
- The recommendation for naming resource groups is to use names that allow for easy identification, such as the Group_TaskType convention.
- Account users (developers in the scenario) require the editor and/or manager roles if they need to create and management services.
```

IAM provides security and consistent access control. It enables customers to securely authenticate users for platform services and control access to resources across the IBM Cloud® platform. IAM can be better understood by considering its two major aspects: identity and access management.

##### Access Control Models

There are two common access control models:

- attribute-based access control (ABAC) and
- role-based access control (RBAC).

##### IAM Roles

With  IAM, enterprises can manage and define access for users and resources in their account. The available role types are service and platform roles.

---

#### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

```
In IBM VPC Defined, you should have learned that a VPC allows an enterprise to establish its own private cloud-linked computing environment.

In Key Features of IBM VPC, you should have learned that the key features of IBM VPC are its agility, availability, security, and affordability.

In Key Features of IBM VPC, you should have learned that the main business benefits of IBM VPC are flexible business growth, reduced risk across the entire data lifecycle, and its features and functionality allow businesses to channel more resources towards innovation.
```

A virtual private cloud (VPC) allows an enterprise to establish its own private cloud-linked computing environment. A VPC lives on a shared public cloud infrastructure.

A primary defining feature of the VPC is it allows an enterprise to define and control a virtual network that is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants. This creates a private and secure place on the public cloud.

##### VPC Architecture

VPCs allow users to deploy cloud resources into their own isolated virtual network. The cloud resources are in three categories: Compute, Storage, and Networking.

---

#### Core Services

```
In Key Features of Virtual Servers Classic, you should have learned that a virtual server shares hardware and software resources with other operating systems.

In Using Public, Transient, Reserved, or Dedicated Classic Virtual Servers, you should have learned that there are four types of virtual servers on IBM Cloud: public, dedicated, transient, and reserved.

In Bare Metal Servers, you should have learned that bare metal servers are single-tenant servers that aren't shared with any other customer.

In Business Benefits of IBM Cloud for VMware, you should have learned that IBM offers VMware based services. VMware develops virtualization software.

In IBM Kubernetes Service, you should have learned that Cloud Kubernetes is an orchestration tool that is used for deploying, managing, and scaling containers.

In Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, you should have learned that OpenShift is an open source development platform that allows users to focus on managing and developing applications.

In Code Engine and Its Benefits, you should have learned that IBM Cloud Code Engine is a fully managed serverless platform that runs containerized workloads.
```

##### IBM Virtual Servers for Classic

A virtual server shares hardware and software resources with other operating systems. Virtual servers for Classic are scalable and purchased with cores and memory allocations. They are key factors when considering compute resources that can be added quickly.

- Seamless integration

```
Due to virtual servers being deployed to network as bare metal servers and network appliances, a user has the flexibility to use top technology for each workload. If multiple virtual servers are being used, they are commonly deployed behind a load balancer.
```

- Fully customizable

```
Workloads and applications are highly available due to redundant resources and highly fault-tolerant zone architectures.
```

- Rapid provisioning

```
There is a five minute or less wait time between order and provisioning.
```

- Remote management

```
A server can be managed remotely using the IBM Cloud console or classic networking API.
```

- Easily scalable

```
A user can quickly and easily scale instances, up or down, and add or remove on demand.
```

When creating a virtual server in the classic infrastructure, the user can choose between a public (multi-tenancy) environment or a dedicated (single-tenancy) environment. Then, depending on the chosen environment, the user must also select hourly, monthly, or transient virtual servers. With public virtual servers, a user can also choose to use either SAN-based storage or local storage.

- Public Virtual Servers
- Transient Virtual Servers
- Reserved Virtual Servers
- Dedicated Virtual Servers

##### Bare Metal Servers Defined

An IBM Cloud bare metal server is a single-tenant server that isn’t shared with any other customer. It provides horsepower for intensive processing and disk input/output (I/O) intensive workloads. Billing options range from hourly, monthly, or a one-year or three-year contract.

##### What is VMware?

VMware develops virtualization software that allows computer hardware to be divided into multiple virtual computers or virtual machines (VMs). Each virtual machine acts as its own computer and runs its own operating system.

##### Kubernetes and Containers

```
Containers are application components that combine source code with all the required libraries that are required to run the code in any environment. Operating System virtualization allows containers to isolate processes and control the amount of CPU, memory, and disk those processes can access.   
The main advantage of containers is providing a level of abstraction that makes them portable and lightweight. The chart below shows the benefits of containers.
```

```
Kubernetes is an orchestration tool that allows users to run and manage their container-based workloads. The primary goals of Kubernetes are to:

- Automate rollouts and rollbacks.
- Make everything associated with deploying and managing containers easier.
- Scale services up or down automatically, depending on utilization.
- Ensure users are only running what is needed.
```

##### Red Hat OpenShift and Its Benefits

Developers use Red Hat OpenShift in order to have a fast and secure way to containerize and deploy enterprise workloads in Kubernetes clusters. Red Hat Openshift is used to simplify various difficult tasks, like deploying applications and doing day-to-day administrative operations, by extended Kubernetes. It is deployable on premises or in a cloud.

Red Hat OpenShift, which is based on Kubernetes, is an open source development platform that allows users to focus on managing and developing applications. The purpose of Red Hat OpenShift is to create an OpenShift cluster of compute hosts to deploy and manage containerized apps on IBM Cloud. OpenShift is a hybrid cloud, Kubernetes container platform that provides a trusted environment to run enterprise workloads.

The benefits of using Red Hat OpenShift are:

- Choice of container platform provider
- Single-tenant Kubernetes clusters with compute, network, and storage infrastructure isolation
- Multizone clusters to increase high availability
- High available masters
- Image security compliance with Vulnerability Advisor
- Continuous monitoring of cluster health
- Secure exposure of apps to the public
- IBM Cloud service integration

##### What is Code Engine?

IBM Cloud Code Engine is a fully managed serverless platform that runs containerized workloads. It automatically scales workloads up and down, and even down to zero when no requests are active. Users pay for only resources they consume.  It allows users to write code, while not having to focus on managing the infrastructure. The Code Engine can manage container images, batch jobs, or source code.

---

#### Common Storage Options

APIs are a convenient way to access applications but it can be difficult to manage a large number of them. API Connect for IBM Cloud allows users to create and manage all of their APIs from one central location.

- API Connect Administrator

API Connect Adminstrators manage API Connect provider organizations and users. They also configure services such as gateways that control customer access to APIs.

- API Developer

Developers create new APIs and update existing ones as needed. They are also able to configure security restrictions, logging rules, and access control quotas.

- API Administrator

API Administrators create groups of APIs called distributions that are made available to end users. They also define and implement plans that determine the different access levels that customers will be able to purchase.

- Product Manager

Product Managers are responsible for access to the Developer Portal. Product Managers create a portal for each group of customers which controls access to the developer portal.

- Consumer

Consumers are customers that are outside the organization. Consumers can subscribe to published APIs so they will be able to use them in their applications.

##### IBM App Connect Overview

When developing solutions for customers, users will often have multiple systems that will have to be connected together. This is not always the easiest task to accomplish. IBM App Connect is a cloud-based, fully managed solution that allows users to connect multiple applications such as Salesforce, SAP, and Marketo.

##### IBM MQ

(which stands for Message Queue) works by accepting transactions from various applications, either synchronously or asynchronously, and queuing them for sequential processing. This ensures that every transaction is received and processed.

##### IBM Event Streams

There are a number of ways to communicate between applications but for solutions where high throughput is needed, IBM Event Streams is especially suited. IBM Event Streams is an event streaming platform built on Apache Kafka. It gives apps the ability to react to events as they happen.

```

##### IBM Cloud Monitoring

Monitoring all the moving parts within a cloud-native application can be complicated since all of these parts operate independently of each other. IBM Cloud Monitoring is a cloud-native and container-intelligence management system that allows users to gain operational visibility into the health of applications, services, and platforms. It also provides a suite of advanced features to gain deeper insights into the performance of their systems.

##### IBM Log Analysis

Because of the distributed nature of cloud systems, error logs can come from a number of independent sources. IBM Log Analysis collects log entries from a variety of sources and concentrates them in one central location. It also gives DevOps teams the ability to analyze the data and export it for compliance auditing requirements.

##### IBM Cloud Activity Tracker

IBM Cloud Activity Tracker is used to track all activity within your IBM Cloud account. This data can be used to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions as well as ensure compliance with regulatory audit requirements.

##### IBM Cloud Security and Compliance

IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center provides templates and automations that act to prevent catastrophic mistakes and compliance incidents. The components within Security and Compliance Center help ensure that a client's environment is continuously monitored and in compliance with applicable standards.
