The most widely known cloud deployment models are:

- public cloud
- private cloud
- virtual private cloud
- hybrid cloud

##### Public Cloud

A public cloud provides access to computing resources for multiple users over the internet. Users can access servers, storage, network, security, and applications that are owned and managed by a cloud service provider. Resources are paid for by subscription or per use pricing.

Some benefits of public cloud are:

- A public cloud is very reliable because there are many available servers and networks.
- Users can easily predict recurring operating expenses by using on-demand resources and only paying for what is used.
- The cloud provider owns the data centers, hardware, and infrastructure on which customer workloads are run and is responsible for all maintenance.

##### Private Cloud

A private cloud (also known as an internal cloud or corporate cloud) is a cloud computing environment in which all hardware and software resources are dedicated exclusively to, and accessible by, a single customer and can be accessed either on or off premises. It can be owned, operated, and managed by a third party, the organization itself, or a combination of both.

Some benefits of private cloud are:

- A user has exclusive access to the cloud computing resources.
- There is greater control over resources, data security, and regulatory compliance.
- Applications and the infrastructure are more easily customized.

##### Hybrid Cloud

A hybrid cloud provides a combination of a public and private cloud infrastructure in a single infrastructure.

Some of the benefits of a hybrid cloud are:

- Users can choose either cloud environment, public or private, for each individual application or workload.  
- Sensitive data and applications can be easily separated and run in an on-premises data center.
- Workloads are easily moved between public and private cloud infrastructure.

Some organizations use the term hybrid cloud when combining cloud and non-cloud or traditional infrastructure.
