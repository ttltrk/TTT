#### The Job Roles that Support Cloud

There are many job roles that organizations can implement in their environment to support IBM Cloud. Identifying the responsibilities of each of these roles and the right individuals in these roles will create success for an organization.

#### The Established Cloud Deployment Models

The most widely known cloud deployment models are:

- public cloud
- private cloud
- virtual private cloud
- hybrid cloud

##### Public Cloud

A public cloud provides access to computing resources for multiple users over the internet. Users can access servers, storage, network, security, and applications that are owned and managed by a cloud service provider. Resources are paid for by subscription or per use pricing.

Some benefits of public cloud are:

- A public cloud is very reliable because there are many available servers and networks.
- Users can easily predict recurring operating expenses by using on-demand resources and only paying for what is used.
- The cloud provider owns the data centers, hardware, and infrastructure on which customer workloads are run and is responsible for all maintenance.

##### Private Cloud

A private cloud (also known as an internal cloud or corporate cloud) is a cloud computing environment in which all hardware and software resources are dedicated exclusively to, and accessible by, a single customer and can be accessed either on or off premises. It can be owned, operated, and managed by a third party, the organization itself, or a combination of both.

Some benefits of private cloud are:

- A user has exclusive access to the cloud computing resources.
- There is greater control over resources, data security, and regulatory compliance.
- Applications and the infrastructure are more easily customized.

##### Hybrid Cloud

A hybrid cloud provides a combination of a public and private cloud infrastructure in a single infrastructure.

Some of the benefits of a hybrid cloud are:

- Users can choose either cloud environment, public or private, for each individual application or workload.  
- Sensitive data and applications can be easily separated and run in an on-premises data center.
- Workloads are easily moved between public and private cloud infrastructure.

Some organizations use the term hybrid cloud when combining cloud and non-cloud or traditional infrastructure.

#### Major Cloud Service Models

```
SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS are the major cloud service models.
A ready to use infrastructure and software application are provided by SaaS.
Customers use PaaS to build, test, run, and update applications quickly.
Customers use IaaS to get access to infrastructure resources such as compute, storage, and networking.
```

##### SaaS - Software as a service

SaaS provides a ready to use infrastructure and software application. The SaaS vendor manages all of the upgrades and maintenance. Users simply create an account, pay a subscription fee, and can start using applications immediately.

Some advantages of SaaS:

- Users can try products on a free trial or for a low monthly fee with minimal financial risk.
- Apps can be accessed over the internet on any device with a browser.
- It is easy to add additional users and storage.

##### PaaS - Platform as a service

PaaS helps developers build, test, run, and update applications quickly and inexpensively without having to manage a hardware platform. However, there is not much control over changes made by the provider. The cloud provider hosts all servers, storage, operating system software, databases, and development tools in their data center, providing a fully functioning development environment.

Some advantages of PaaS:

- Hardware and software do not need to be purchased to build and maintain an application development platform because the cloud provider manages the entire platform.  
- More choices for development tools and databases are available.
- Additional compute, storage, and networking capacity can be purchased quickly and used immediately.

##### IaaS - Infrastracture as a service

IaaS provides infrastructure resources such as compute, storage, security, and networking on demand. It allows users to increase or decrease resources, as needed. The cloud provider only manages physical compute resources, data centers, network, and security resources. Control over resources is limited.

Some advantages of IaaS:

- Customers receive pre-virtualized compute, network, and storage resources.
- Users can provision, test, and scale resources quickly.
- IaaS providers are in many locations around the world, reducing latency and improving performance.

##### CaaS - Container as a service

It is worth mentioning that container as a service (CaaS) is another cloud service model often used. It is container based virtualization. The cloud provider delivers container engines, orchestration, and underlying compute resources to users.

#### Emergent Cloud Deployment Models

```
In Distributed Cloud, you should have learned that:

- Distributed cloud allows users to run public cloud services in multiple locations.
- IBM Cloud Satellite is a distributed cloud solution.
- Users can run workloads close to where the data is created using edge computing.
- Distributed cloud enables the processing of data, such as personal data, in a specific location, which helps meet regulatory compliance.

In Multicloud, you should have learned that:

- Multicloud users can use cloud services from more than one cloud vendor.
- Users choose a combination of pricing, performance, security, and compliance requirements from different cloud providers.
- When there is an outage on one cloud, it may not impact services offered on another cloud.
- Many organizations use a hybrid multicloud.
```

##### Distributed Cloud

Distributed cloud is a cloud computing model that enables users to run public cloud services in multiple locations. Locations can be on premises, in a cloud provider's data center, in third-party, or colocation centers. Everything can be managed in a single control plane.

IBM offers a distributed cloud solution with IBM CloudÂ® Satellite. It helps users deploy and run applications across on premises, edge computing, and public cloud environments.

##### Edge Computing

Edge Computing is the process of running workloads close to where the data is created. Data does not have to be moved to a central cloud data center for processing and then back to where process automation occurs. As a result, applications can process large amounts of data very quickly, in real time.

##### Multicloud

Multicloud is a cloud computing model that refers to using cloud services from more than one cloud vendor. Businesses often use platform as a service (PaaS) or infrastructure as a service (IaaS) from multiple cloud service providers, such as IBM Cloud and Microsoft Azure. They may even use software as a service (SaaS) from different cloud providers, such as Salesforce and Workday.

#### IBM Cloud Interface

##### IBM Cloud Console

The IBM Cloud console is an interface where users can access, reference, and manage cloud resources. The cloud console also provides access to the IBM Cloud catalog, cloud documents, IBM support center, the cost estimator tool, IBM Cloud shell, and account management tools.

When a user has an account and is logged into IBM Cloud, the cloud console provides the means to create resources from the dashboard. From the dashboard, users can easily access documentation, the cloud services catalog, see billing information, and seek support.
