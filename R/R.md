#### SYNTAX

```r
"Hello World"

>>>
[1] "Hello World"
>>>
```

```r
5
10
15
7+7

>>>
[1] "Hello World"
[1] 5
[1] 10
[1] 15
[1] 14
>>>
```

#### COMMENTS

Comments can be used to explain R code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.
Comments starts with a ```#```. When executing the R-code, R will ignore anything that starts with ```#```.

```r
# This is a comment
"Hello World!"

>>>
[1] "Hello World!"
>>>
```

```r
"Hello World!" # This is a comment

>>>
[1] "Hello World!"
>>>
```

Comments does not have to be text to explain the code, it can also be used to prevent R from executing the code:

```r
# "Good morning!"
"Good night!"

>>>
[1] "Good night!"
>>>
```

##### MULTILINE_COMMENTS

Unlike other programming languages, such as Java, there are no syntax in R for multiline comments. However, we can just insert a ```#``` for each line to create multiline comments:

```r
# This is a comment
# written in
# more than just one line
"Hello World!"

>>>
[1] "Hello World!"
>>>
```

#### VARIABLES

##### - CREATING_VARIABLES

Variables are containers for storing data values.

R does not have a command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. To assign a value to a variable, use the ```<-``` sign. To output (or print) the variable value, just type the variable name:

```r
name <- "John"
age <- 40

name   # output "John"
age    # output 40

>>>
[1] "John"
[1] 40
>>>
```

From the example above, name and age are variables, while "John" and 5 are values.

In other programming language, it is common to use ```=``` as an assignment operator. In R, we can use both ```=``` and ```<-``` as assignment operators.
However, ```<-``` is preferred in most cases because the ```=``` operator can be forbidden in some context in R.

##### PRINT_OUTPUT_VARIABLES

```r

>>>

>>>
```

##### CONCATENATE_VARIABLES

```r

>>>

>>>
```

##### MULTIPLE_VARIABLES

```r

>>>

>>>
```

##### VARIABLE_NAMES

```r

>>>

>>>
```
