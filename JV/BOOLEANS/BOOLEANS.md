### BOOLEANS

---

* [](#)

---

Very often, in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like:

```
YES / NO
ON / OFF
TRUE / FALSE
```

For this, Java has a boolean data type, which can store true or false values.

#### BOOLEAN_VALUES

A boolean type is declared with the boolean keyword and can only take the values true or false

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean isJavaFun = true;
        boolean isFishTasty = false;

        System.out.println(isJavaFun);
        System.out.println(isFishTasty);   
    }
}

>>>
true
false
>>>
```

#### BOLLEAN_EXPRESSION

A Boolean expression returns a boolean value: true or false.
This is useful to build logic, and find answers.
For example, you can use a comparison operator, such as the greater than (>) operator, to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true or false:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        int y = 9;

        System.out.println(x > y);
    }
}

>>>
true
>>>
```
