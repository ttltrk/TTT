Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets

```java
String[] cars;
```

We have now declared a variable that holds an array of strings. To insert values to it, you can place the values in a comma-separated list, inside curly braces:

```java
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
```

To create an array of integers, you could write:

```java
int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};
```
