### SWITCH

#### Java Switch Statements

Instead of writing many if..else statements, you can use the switch statement.

The switch statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed:

```jv

int day = 4;
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    System.out.println("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    System.out.println("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    System.out.println("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 4:
    System.out.println("Thursday");
    break;
  case 5:
    System.out.println("Friday");
    break;
  case 6:
    System.out.println("Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    System.out.println("Sunday");
    break;
}

>>>
"Thursday"
>>>
```

#### The default Keyword

The default keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case match:

```jv
int day = 4;
switch (day) {
  case 6:
    System.out.println("Today is Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    System.out.println("Today is Sunday");
    break;
  default:
    System.out.println("Looking forward to the Weekend");
}

>>>
"Looking forward to the Weekend"
>>>
```

Note that if the default statement is used as the last statement in a switch block, it does not need a break.
