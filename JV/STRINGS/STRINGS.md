Strings are used for storing text.

A String variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String greeting = "Hello";

        System.out.println(greeting);

    }
}

>>>
Hello
>>>
```

#### STRING_LENGTH

A String in Java is actually an object, which contain methods that can perform certain operations on strings. For example, the length of a string can be found with the length() method:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";

        System.out.println("The length of the txt string is: " + txt.length());

    }
}

>>>
The length of the txt string is: 26
>>>
```
