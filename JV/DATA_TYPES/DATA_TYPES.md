### DATA_TYPES

---

Data types are divided into two groups:

- Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
- Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes (you will learn more about these in a later chapter)

#### PRIMITIVE_DATA_TYPES

A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods.
There are eight primitive data types in Java:

Data Type	| Size | Description
----------|------|-------------
byte	    | 1 byte |	Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
short	    | 2 bytes | Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
int	      | 4 bytes	| Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long	    | 8 bytes	| Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float	    | 4 bytes	| Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
double	  | 8 bytes	| Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
boolean	  | 1 bit	  | Stores true or false values
char	    | 2 bytes	| Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values

#### NUMBERS

Primitive number types are divided into two groups:

- Integer types stores whole numbers, positive or negative (such as 123 or -456), without decimals. Valid types are byte, short, int and long. Which type you should use, depends on the numeric value.

- Floating point types represents numbers with a fractional part, containing one or more decimals. There are two types: float and double.
