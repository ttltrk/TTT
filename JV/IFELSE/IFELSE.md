You already know that Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

```
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
Equal to a == b
Not Equal to: a != b
```

You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.

Java has the following conditional statements:

```
Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
```

#### IF

Use the if statement to specify a block of Java code to be executed if a condition is true.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (20 > 18) {
            System.out.println("20 is greater than 18");
        }

    }
}

>>>
20 is greater than 18
>>>
```


```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 20;
        int y = 18;

        if (x > y) {
            System.out.println("x is greater than y");
        }

    }
}

>>>
x is greater than y
>>>
```
