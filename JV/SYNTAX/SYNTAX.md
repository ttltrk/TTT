### SYNTAX

---

In the previous chapter, we created a Java file called Main.java, and we used the following code to print "Hello World" to the screen:

```jv
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}

>>>
Hello World
>>>
```

Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Main. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.

Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
