- IBM Services for Salesforce Around the World

```
IBM has invested significantly in its Salesforce practice and has designated IBM Services
for Salesforce one of the company's Global Innovation Units. During that time
the majority of the work being completed by the Salesforce team was located in the US,
Europe, and ANZ. Today, our Salesforce practice has expanded across the globe
to include areas such as LATAM and APAC. We now have eight offices in the US,
12 offices in Europe, and four offices in APAC. In addition to these 24 global offices,
we have GIC based Salesforce Centers, allowing us to provide our clients with effective
around the clock and affordable delivery solutions.

The growth of IBM Services for Salesforce is not stopping there. As we have heard
from both Mark and Paul in previous sections, we are looking to grow IBM Services
for Salesforce substantially in the upcoming years by putting the Salesforce platform front
and center as GBS’s recommended front-end solution for all of our clients.
Salesforce continues to experience exponential growth, and it is our opportunity to capitalize on that expansion.

Saul Berman, Executive VP and Global Chief Strategist, will now share his vision
for the expansion of IBM Services for Salesforce globally.

As Mark Foster recently announced, IBM has consolidated the company's go-to-market structure
from seven geographies to four: the Americas, Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA),

to better enable us to increase focus on our clients.

This section focuses on The Americas.

```

- IBM Services for Salesforce in LATAM

```
The newest emerging market for IBM Services for Salesforce is Latin America.
Over the past couple of years, we have been investing heavily in the region
and working to grow our client base across the area. Salesforce sees Latin America
as a growth region for them as well. As companies in this region continue to buy
into the Salesforce platform there will be an incredible opportunity to grow
IBM’s Salesforce presence in the region as well. Our current LATAM headquarters is in Sao Paulo,
Brazil, however we also have emerging resources across Central America.

Our continuously growing practice in LATAM is led by Alexandre Arello with the support
of the iX LATAM practice lead, Carlos Jose Rivelle, and GBS LATAM practice lead,
Thais Lima De Marca.
