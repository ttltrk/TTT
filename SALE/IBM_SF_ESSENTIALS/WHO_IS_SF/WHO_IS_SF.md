#### WHO_IS_SALESFORCE

```
Within this module you will learn about the Salesforce “ethos”. You will be introduced to Salesforce
not only as a platform but also as a company. We will review the Salesforce origin and growth story,
learn about the CEO and founder, Marc Benioff and also learn a bit more about the current
Salesforce offerings and culture that makes the company so special.
