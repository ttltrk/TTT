#### INTRO

```
Salesforce was founded in 1999 by the CEO, Marc Benioff, EVP Parker Harris, founding architect Dave Mollenhoff,
and former partner Frank Dominguez. This team built the Salesforce product and platform with a vision to change
the way people worked and did business. They believed that buying software should be “as easy as buying a book.”

The company originally began as a SaaS company focused on improving sales organizations with their
innovative Sales Cloud product. While the company began in this one area, Marc always had a larger vision
for the company which drove him to grow the company to a suite of over 20 products that are fit for any industry.

In addition to growing the company’s vision to help all organizations across the world improve their processes,
they also wanted to promote a new cultural revolution. Salesforce believes that the more you can do for the world,
the more that will come back to you. This belief is founded on their four pillars of social justice: trust,
customer success, innovation, and equality. This belief has been recognized across the industry. In fact,
as a Salesforce Partner, our Bluewolf group is required to record our team's volunteer hours
and non-profit activities meeting a certain threshold to maintain our partnership. On the bright side,
this belief in doing good for the world is a philosophy IBM and Salesforce share, so it's easy to attain!

Salesforce has been named “One of the most innovative companies in the world” by Forbes,
“One of the world’s most admired companies” by Fortune, “#1 in the world’s best workplaces”
by Great Place to Work, “The Top 100 best companies to work for” by Fortune, and “#1 best workplace”
by Indeed. These accolades go to show that while the product of Salesforce is phenomenal,
their success is further enhanced by their culture, beliefs, and mission.
