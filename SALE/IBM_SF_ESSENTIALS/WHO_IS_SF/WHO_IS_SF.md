#### INTRO

```
Salesforce was founded in 1999 by the CEO, Marc Benioff, EVP Parker Harris, founding architect Dave Mollenhoff,
and former partner Frank Dominguez. This team built the Salesforce product and platform with a vision to change
the way people worked and did business. They believed that buying software should be “as easy as buying a book.”

The company originally began as a SaaS company focused on improving sales organizations with their
innovative Sales Cloud product. While the company began in this one area, Marc always had a larger vision
for the company which drove him to grow the company to a suite of over 20 products that are fit for any industry.

In addition to growing the company’s vision to help all organizations across the world improve their processes,
they also wanted to promote a new cultural revolution. Salesforce believes that the more you can do for the world,
the more that will come back to you. This belief is founded on their four pillars of social justice: trust,
customer success, innovation, and equality. This belief has been recognized across the industry. In fact,
as a Salesforce Partner, our Bluewolf group is required to record our team's volunteer hours
and non-profit activities meeting a certain threshold to maintain our partnership. On the bright side,
this belief in doing good for the world is a philosophy IBM and Salesforce share, so it's easy to attain!

Salesforce has been named “One of the most innovative companies in the world” by Forbes,
“One of the world’s most admired companies” by Fortune, “#1 in the world’s best workplaces”
by Great Place to Work, “The Top 100 best companies to work for” by Fortune, and “#1 best workplace”
by Indeed. These accolades go to show that while the product of Salesforce is phenomenal,
their success is further enhanced by their culture, beliefs, and mission.

#### SF_OHANA

```
"The business of business should not be business, it should be to improve the state of the world."
- Marc Benioff, CEO & Founder of Salesforce

Salesforce’s culture is not limited to just the employees that work at the company.
The Salesforce “Ohana” extends to all of the hundreds of thousands of clients and employees
who work on the Salesforce platform. Salesforce celebrates the accomplishments of their clients
and their “Trailblazers” every year by inviting them to one of the largest technology conferences
in the world, Dreamforce, in their home city of San Francisco. This event encapsulates
all that Salesforce stands for and believes in. It is filled with new innovative product launches,
incredible client stories, and exciting events and speakers from some of the largest performers
and figures in the world. Salesforce believes in celebrating their culture and promoting their values
through this phenomenal event - which will be held virtually in 2020 for the first time ever.

Trailblazers are the backbone of the Salesforce community. They are experts in their craft
and work to improve their skills on Salesforce’s learning an enablement “Trailhead” platform.
This platform was built to skill the masses and invite everyone to be a part of the Salesforce Ohana.
