### MARKETING_CLOUD

---

```
Salesforce Marketing Cloud is a foundational cloud service provided by Salesforce.
Salesforce Marketing Cloud was born out of an acquisition of ExactTarget back in 2013
and has been continuously innovated upon ever since.

Salesforce Marketing Cloud is built primarily to track “customer journeys”
using email marketing, text message marketing, and social media monitoring services.
It provides marketing organizations the ability to easily configure the platform
to meet their customer journey needs by using a pre-built data model and plug and play
configuration-based system that allows Marketing teams to add fields, update page layouts,
and add automation without having to create any new code.

The foundation of Marketing Cloud is the ability to track customer journeys as they interact
with your company’s product or service. Marketing teams can create configurable flows
that allow them to use predefined criteria to automate the messaging that will be sent
to clients without creating any custom code. These customer journeys are monitored,
and marketing teams can use automated reporting to track how their campaigns and journeys
are performing with their customers. Marketing Cloud can also be improved upon
by using additional AppExchange packages, Salesforce tools such as MuleSoft,
and custom coding using their easy to understand SOQL language.

Marketing Cloud has been implemented in thousands of companies across the world.
At IBM we have implemented and improved the Marketing Cloud instances of hundreds
of companies and continue to be an innovative leader in this space.
