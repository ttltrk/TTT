### SALES_CLOUD

---

```
Salesforce Sales Cloud was the first cloud created by Salesforce back in 1999.
It was the foundation for much of Salesforce’s business and was the only cloud offered
by Salesforce until 2009.

Salesforce Sales Cloud is built primarily to track sales leads, accounts,
contacts, and opportunities. It provides sales organizations the ability to easily
configure the platform to meet their sales recording and reporting needs by using
a pre-built data model and plug and play configuration-based system that allows sales teams
to add fields, update page layouts, and add automation without having to create any new code.

The foundational flow of Sales Cloud is the ability to track leads that your company is
looking to close within the future months. Those leads can then be converted to accounts
and contacts with child opportunities beneath them. These opportunities have
a probability of closing which feeds directly into your sales pipeline and allows
executives at the company to understand what their sales forecast looks like
for the upcoming months. From there Sales Cloud provides easy to use reporting
and automation tools to help improve the probability and accuracy of closing deals.

Sales Cloud can also be improved upon by using additional AppExchange packages,
Salesforces tools such as Einstein or Mulesoft, and custom coding using their
easy to understand SOQL language.

Sales Cloud has been implemented in thousands of companies across the world.
At IBM we have implemented and improved the Sales Cloud instances of hundreds
of companies and continue to be an innovative leader in this space.

sales cloud and service cloud two cornerstones
```

- First, the Basics. What Is Sales Cloud?

```
If you're thinking, "Sales Cloud? I thought we were talking about Salesforce," fear not.
You're in the right place to get your questions answered. Here are a few basic
definitions to get started:

- CRM stands for customer relationship management. It's a system that keeps your
customer information in one place, so your team can manage your contact with
your customers with this full history in mind. This makes for happy customers.

- Salesforce is the first company that took CRM to the cloud, enabling companies
to access all of their customer information online, from any device, anywhere in the world, 24/7.

- Sales Cloud is part of the CRM system that Salesforce offers. Sales Cloud is created
especially for salespeople. Because it's our most popular product, many people say
Salesforce when they actually mean Sales Cloud. Now you know!
```

- How to Know That Sales Cloud Is Right for You

```
At a very high level, you're acquainted with what Sales Cloud is—but how do you know
if you really need it? Think about the way you do business, and look around your office.
Do you see any of these classic signs that you need a better way to track customers?

- Your customer info is all over the place. There's customer info on sticky notes,
in Excel spreadsheets, and in your email-marketing system, making it really hard to see
the complete picture. Growth is blocked when you're not prepared for customer conversations
or able to fully track your business.

- You're losing critical information. When customer data is in different places,
or just in reps' heads, important details go missing and collaboration breaks down.
Worse, when reps leave the company so does your customer data!

- You don't have a plan to scale fast. What happens when demand surges or your team grows fast?
First, do a celebratory dance at your desk, but next ask yourself:
Will your current sales processes scale? Make sure you have systems in place
that scale as fast as your business grows.

- Running reports is a painful and tedious process.
You want to analyze your sales team's monthly progress against its quota,
but who has the time to do it manually? You have questions about how effective
your selling process is, but you don't have the tools to find answers.
When you're starting to avoid reporting like the plague, it's time for a change.

- You have to sit down at a desk to push a deal forward. As we all know,
sales people carry floppy discs, work from 9 to 5, and do 100% of their work on a
desktop computer. Wait, it's not 1999? Mobile is a must-have, not a nice-to-have.
Modern sales reps share data, get approvals, and push deals forward on their smartphones.

- You're stuck with the status quo. Your business has unique needs so you need a system
that can flex with you—something you can customize to your processes, your customers,
and your team.
