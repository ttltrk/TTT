```
Salesforce Commerce Cloud is the newest foundational cloud service provided by Salesforce.
Salesforce Commerce Cloud was born out of an acquisition of CloudCraze in 2018
and has been continuously innovated upon ever since.

Salesforce Commerce Cloud works for B2B as well as B2C and works primarily to assist with order management,
branding, and customized product recommendations. With Commerce Cloud,
companies can connect shopping experiences to marketing, sales, and service,
build beautiful commerce experiences and personalized campaigns, boost conversions,
make better recommendations with AI, and implement new technology twice as fast to scale their business.

Commerce Cloud provides organizations the ability to easily configure the platform to meet
the needs of their commerce site by using a pre-built data model and plug and play configuration-based system
that allows teams to add fields, update page layouts, and add automation without having to create any new code.
In addition to the back-end AI and data model capabilities, Commerce Cloud also allows you
the ability to create and publish content for any commerce experience.
Working with a front end and back end solution, Commerce Cloud makes it easy for companies
to create a unified commerce experience using omnichannel capabilities and solutions
to create customized journeys for their customers.

Commerce Cloud has been implemented in hundreds of companies across the world.
At IBM we have implemented and improved the Commerce Cloud instances of many companies
and continue to be an innovative leader in this space.
