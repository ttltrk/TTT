### CPQ

---

```
Salesforce CPQ (configure, price, quote) was born out of an acquisition of Steelbrick in 2016. Salesforce CPQ, as the name states, allows companies the ability to easily configure, price, and quote companies using standard Salesforce products, pricebooks, and opportunities. This platform easily takes unstructured data from Salesforce and turns it into a customized PDF document to send to your customers as an invoice. In addition, Salesforce CPQ can support your commerce platform to easily calculate and price out the cost of a group of products your customers would like to purchase.
