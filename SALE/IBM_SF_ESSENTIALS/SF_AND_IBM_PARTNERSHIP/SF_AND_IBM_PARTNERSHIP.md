#### WHAT_IS_SF

Salesforce is much more than a CRM solution; it is a transformation suite of cloud products that enhance both the client and employee experience. Salesforce lives in the cloud so it is highly customizable, adaptable, and configurable to fit almost any business's needs.

Salesforce has more than 150,000 customers worldwide, all using the platform in unique ways to improve how they do business. With all of the different clouds and options that Salesforce has to offer, many of these companies need a strategic partner such as IBM to help them leverage all of Salesforce's capabilities. With IBMs large enterprise experience and products, combined with Salesforceâ€™s transformational technology there is a world of possibilities ahead for our partnership.
