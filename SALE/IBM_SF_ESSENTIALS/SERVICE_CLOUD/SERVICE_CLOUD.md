### SERVICE_CLOUD

---

```
Salesforce Service Cloud was one of the first clouds created by Salesforce.
Service Cloud is built primarily to track accounts, service cases, and tasks.
It provides service organizations the ability to easily configure the platform to meet
their service recording and reporting needs by using a pre-built data model
and plug-and-play configuration-based system that allows service teams to add fields,
update page layouts, and add automation without having to create any new code.

The foundational flow of Service Cloud is the ability to create cases for accounts
and contacts that contact your service center and create tasks to track the follow up
required with these accounts. Service Cloudâ€™s data model is set up to easily plug and play
for any service center requirements and needs.

Service Cloud also offers their primary feature, the Service Console, which allows
service center teams the ability to see all historical account, case, and contact information
all on one screen while speaking with the customer, which prevents swivel chair
and the need for multiple data tracking systems. In addition, Service Cloud provides the ability
to route cases based upon predefined criteria to ensure you are reaching your maximum service
center efficiency.

Service Cloud can also be improved upon by using additional AppExchange packages,
Salesforces tools such as Einstein or Live Chat, and custom coding using their easy
to understand SOQL language.

Service Cloud has been implemented in thousands of companies. At IBM we have implemented
and improved the Service Cloud instances of hundreds of companies and continue
to be an innovative leader in this space.
